    "text": "Today’s research is largely done in universities, but it was not always so. Before the adoption of the Humboldt model of universities (as institutions of research and teaching) in Germany in the early 19th century and its subsequent generalization, research was mainly organized by academies, which initially operated like clubs funded by their members: an international group of science amateurs. I highlight the word amateur here since the professional status of the scientist as it is understood today is a relatively recent historical development.\nAlthough there is a stereotype of the scientist as a mad professor alone his laboratory, history shows that science has always been a collective effort. The first scientific societies – which were more like private clubs – were formed in the 1600s in some of Europe’s major cities. Most of these clubs evaluated research and technology on behalf of their monarch, such as The Royal Society of London, which is the oldest scientific academy to still exist today. Founded in 1660, the Royal Society became a publishing venue for scientific ideas and reports, and was critical in the formation of a scholarly communication network throughout Europe.\nAlso founded in 1660 was the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Unlike London’s Royal Society, which was not financially supported by the monarchy, the Paris academy awarded government stipends to a small group of scientists. These stipends helped legitimize science as a profession while drawing upon the vast resources of the kingdom, and by the 1700s, being elected to the Académie des Sciences carried great prestige and financial assurances. As with the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences paved the way for scientific publication by publishing proceedings from its meetings.\nDespite these scientists’ supposed interest in attaining enlightenment, they were as discriminatory as anybody else from back then, allowing mostly prominent citizens from noble families into these early societies. The first woman was admitted into the Royal Society as late as 1945. There’s no way to measure how much greater our knowledge would be if early scientific clubs had been open to all citizens.\nNonetheless, the emergence of the Royal Academy and the Académie des Sciences inspired other aspiring scientists throughout Europe. Societies became a crucial part of science, allowing researchers to coordinate and evaluate their efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Royal Society of London, you can check out their website: https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/\n\n\nThe institutionalization of science took place gradually over the last 2 centuries and greatly accelerated after World War I and World War II, which brought scientific development (which played a decisive role in the outcome of the war) to the forefront of national priorities. While the international scientific community had long existed and transcended geopolitical boundaries, governments came to realize the importance of developing a national research capacity to decrease their reliance on other countries for the production and application of new knowledge. This contributed to the massification of research and higher education, as well as the proliferation of universities and university professors, effectively operating a full transition from science as a hobby to science as a profession."

    "section": "2.2 Mertonian framework",
    "text": "2.2 Mertonian framework\nMerton was a highly influential American sociologist who is said to have essentially created the modern sociology of science. For Merton, the institutional goal of science is the extension of certified knowledge, and the ethos of science comprises that goal and a set of norms that ensure its fulfillment. The following sections provide an overview of the part of his work, as well as the work of some of his students and close collaborators, through which they sought to understand the conditions under which science as a social system operates in accordance with the ethos of science and sometimes deviate from it.\n\n2.2.1 The norms of science\nMerton (1942) defined four norms of science which are binding to all scientists:\n\nCommunism: Science is a common good. This emphasizes the importance of the dissemination of discoveries, which is necessary for their inclusion in the common stock of knowledge.\nUniversalism: Contributions to the advancement of knowledge need to be judged for their own merit irrespective of the characteristics of the individuals or groups involved. Similarly, access to scientific careers must be based on relevant criteria and not sociodemographic characteristics or other irrelevant factors.\nDisinterestedness refers to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and for the benefit of humankind, and not for personal gains. Scientists are characterized by a passion for knowledge, curiosity, and the desire to ameliorate the human condition. Merton emphasizes that if scientists, as a group, disproportionally exhibit these characteristics, it’s because the scientific system rewards disinterestedness and not so much because naturally disinterested people decide to become scientists.\nOrganized skepticism:This norm operates at two levels. First, the institution of science exercises a collective form of skepticism towards beliefs and truth claims and seeks to subject them to thorough examination and empirical validation. Second, every scientific contribution must be subjected to the unbiased scrutiny of peers before being accepted as such and incorporated into the common stock of scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Reward system of science\nBecause of the norms of communism and disinterestedness, the motivation of researchers is the recognition they receive from their peers (Zuckerman 1977a). As J. R. Cole and Cole (1973) put it:\n\nBecause recognition is so important to scientists, there must be a reward system that identifies and honors scientific excellence wherever it is found. If a scientist desires to acquire “property”, he can only do so through recognition by the system, since there are no other legitimate ways to obtain property in science. (p. 46)\n\nBecause the role of researchers is to advance knowledge, the scientific community gradually developed a reward system through which those who best fulfill this role are compensated (Merton 1957). This system works well when those who deserve recognition receive it, and the most promising researchers are provided with the resources they need to realize their potential. According to Merton (1973) this benefits both the individual researchers and science as a whole.\nThe reward system comprises many reward mechanisms that form a hierarchy. For Merton (1957), the most permanent and prestigious form of institutionalized recognition in science is eponymic reward: the practice of attaching a researcher’s name to a discovery (e.g., Zipf law, Planck’s constant, or Copernican system), a field (Comte, father of sociology), or a period (e.g., the Freudian era, the Darwinian era). Other prestigious forms of reward include honorific awards like the Nobel prize, membership to academies of science, or other nobility titles. Those who receive such prestigious titles are often seen as the scientific elite and are at the top of the stratified social structure of science (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\nBecause there are limited spots at the top of the hierarchy, there are many researchers whose contributions may be just as extraordinary (if not more) than those of Nobel prize winners but are not awarded such honours (Merton 1968). The scientific community thus creates less prestigious awards and prizes to highlight these accomplishments. However, these are still few in number and only bestowed upon a minority of researchers (Zuckerman 1977b; S. Cole and Cole 1967). So again, there are other mechanisms to reward accomplished scientists, such as nomination to important positions in scientific institutions or as editors of scholarly journals. At the bottom of the hierarchy, visibility is the most basic form of scientific reward: being published and cited by peers (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\n\n\n2.2.3 Social stratification\nThe social stratification of science is a systematic effect of the differentiation and evaluation of researchers who are positioned in a structure that determines their access to resources and opportunities Merton (1968) based on their recognized contributions or potential. Prestigious institutions with more resources recruit Individuals with recognized potential which confers to these individuals (and to the institutions) a competitive advantage. And so does the stratified social structure of science take form through a mixture of self and social selection (Merton 1979). Through their contributions to science, the researchers will then accumulate power and authority, maintain or grow their advantage, and contribute to the asymmetric distribution of resources, productivity, visibility and prestige (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\n\n\n2.2.4 Accumulation of advantages and disadvantages\nThe social stratification of science can generate the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages by scientists, thus increasing the gap between the haves and the have-nots (Zuckerman 1998). Identifying promising researchers and providing them with a certain advantage has a short and long-term effect on their careers. When it is working optimally, the divide between the haves and the have-nots grows exponentially. The best performing researchers obtaining more resources, which they use to perform even better and in return obtain even more resources, and so on. According to Zuckerman (1998), the system would become dysfunctional if resource allocation were based on criteria that don’t relate to performance (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity) or if resources were equally or randomly distributed. Overall, the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages contributes to the social stratification of science which, according to Zuckerman (1998), is essential for the optimization of the scientific system and the advancement of knowledge.\n\n2.2.4.1 Matthew effect\nThe value of a scientific contribution and the recognition that the researchers obtain in return is inevitably based on the subjective judgment of their peers, which can introduce some dysfunctions in the reward system, such as what Merton (1968) called the Matthew Effect, defined as “the accruing of greater increments of recognition for particular scientific contributions to scientists of considerable repute and the withholding of such recognition from scientists who have not yet made their mark” (p. 53). According to J. R. Cole and Cole (1973), the Matthew effect is a direct effect of the social stratification of science, which amplifies the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages by overestimating the merit of some researchers at the detriment of others. The Matthew effect occurs at many levels, such as the recognition of one’s accomplishments, in peer-review, awards, research funding and so on.\n\n\n2.2.4.2 Mathilda effect\nRossiter (1993) showed three decades ago that women in science tended to be disadvantaged by being deprived partly or totally of recognition for their scientific contributions. Like the Matthew effect, this violates the norm of universalism. Some of the most significant scientific discoveries made by women led to their male collaborators winning the Nobel Prize. Even if today the gap between men and women in science has narrowed, women remain less likely then men to obtain awards or important positions Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) and tend to be less cited (Larivière et al. 2013). It should be acknowledged here that these theories were developed before the generalized recognition of gender as a non-binary concept, and that the disadvantages discussed here have been shown to apply to minorities and equity-deserving groups more broadly. I should also mention here that still to this day, bibliometric studies tend to to operationalize gender as a binary concept, which is mostly due to the fact that bibliographic databases do not usually provide the gender of authors, and we must then rely on other available data like first names and geographical location to guess the gender of authors."

    "title": "2  The social structure of science",
    "section": "2.3 Bourdieusian framework",
    "text": "2.3 Bourdieusian framework\nWe now turn our attention to the theories developed by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, whose perspective on science is fundamentally different than Merton’s as it is centred not around a set of institutional goals and norms but around power struggles between pragmatic self-interested agents.\n\n2.3.1 Field and agents\nAccording to Bourdieu (1975), the social space is divided in several distinct fields that are relatively autonomous and have specific interests and stakes. Science can be understood as a field with the specific goal of advancing knowledge. The field is composed of agents that possess different forms of capital (discussed below) and can be defined as entities recognized by their peers and who internalize the goals and norms of the field. There are two key concepts in this definition. First, the concept of recognition here highlights that certain conditions must be met for an agent to integrate a field, and the concept of internalization, which is tied to the concept of habitus discussed further..\nThe structure of a field is determined by the relative position occupied by all of the agents in the field based on the type and amount of capital they possess. This structure is dynamic because agents within a field constantly compete and mobilize their capital to acquire more capital, increase their symbolic power, and dominate the field.\nThere are also meta-fields which have some degree of influence on many other fields. The state is an example of a meta-field since it can, to some degree, impose regulations on other fields and play an important role in distributing resources within fields (e.g., funding corporations and universities). Bourdieu’s theory also includes a field of power composed of agents with a lot of capital that they can use to gain influence in other fields. Think, for example, of movie stars who can mobilize that stardom to gain political influence.\nThe concept of sub-fields is also important. For instance, the scientific community is formed by a set of agents that share a goal (advancing knowledge), but it is also composed of many sub-fields with their own specific goals (e.g., the production of knowledge in a certain area), practices and norms. The existence of meta-fields and sub-fields highlights the limited autonomy of fields.\n\n\n2.3.2 Capital\nBourdieu’s theory of capital incorporates Durkheim’s concept of cultural capital and Marx’s concept of economic capital, to which it adds the concepts of social capital and symbolic capital. Every field also has its form of capital (e.g., scientific capital) that can only be acquired within the field and has limited utility outside it.\n\n2.3.2.1 Economic capital\nEconomic capital comprises an agent’s financial resources, material assets, revenues, and means of production. This capital can be transformed into other types of capital. For instance, in the scientific field, a researcher might invest various forms of economic capital (research funds, work, equipment) to produce a contribution to knowledge and thus obtain some scientific capital.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Social capital\nBourdieu (1980) defines social capital as resources available or potentially available to an agent by virtue of their belonging to a group, to a network of agents that recognize the links that unite them. The social capital of an agent is thus the extent of the network (number of nodes), the type and amount of capital that the connected agents possess, and the capacity of the agent to mobilize this capital. Social capital is acquired through efforts to create and maintain relationships through events (e.g., conferences), places (e.g., research laboratories), and practices (e.g., collaboration, peer review).\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Cultural capital\nAccording to Bourdieu (1979), cultural capital can be embodied, objectified, or institutionalized. Embodied cultural capital is the knowledge of an agent. Objectified cultural capital can be things like books, works of art, or musical instruments. Finally, an example of institutionalized cultural capital is a diploma. While agents may not recognize embodied capital within a field, diplomas and similar credentials can often guarantee a minimal degree of recognition within a field.\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Symbolic capital\nThe knowledge and recognition by agents of a field of the different forms of capital than an agent possesses confers symbolic capital to that agent Bourdieu (1987). Thus, symbolic capital is a form of meta-capital that is the supreme objective of agents’ actions in a field, as it is the recognition of one’s position within it. The distribution of symbolic capital ultimately determines the power structure at play in the field.\n\n\n2.3.2.5 Scientific capital\nScientific capital is a form of symbolic capital specific to the scientific field which determines its structure (Bourdieu 1975). It is the recognition by peers of one’s contribution to scientific progress (Bourdieu 1997). It provides its owner scientific authority and legitimacy in scientific matters. Scientific capital is provided by peers, which are also competitors. This is one of the most important features of science (peer review) and is related to the organized skepticism norm. Furthermore, not all contributions are equal, so the amount of scientific capital an agent may possess is determined by the value and originality of their contribution. The scientific article (or other forms of scholarly publications) materializes that contribution and is an example of what Bourdieu (1971) calls “symbolic goods”: objects that have some value in symbolic capital within a specific field.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Habitus\nThe habitus of an individual is their mental representation of the world and of their position and the position of others within it. It is the structure of the field in its embodied form Bourdieu (1989). Agents acquire the habitus of a specific field through learning and experience within it. Through this process, agents eventually recognize the goals, norms, and structure of the field and are thus able to invest their capital strategically. The field and the habitus are thus interdependent. The habitus is structured by the field of which it is an embodied form, but it also structures the field since it guides the action of agents, which alter the structure of the field.\nThe habitus produces some regularity in the action of agents because it is derived from an objective structure common to all. However, Bourdieu’s theory insists that agents are guided by pragmatism more than by norms or rules. As Bourdieu (1986) points out, “we must avoid seeing in agent’s behaviour more logic than there is, because the logic of pragmatism is to be logical to a point where being logical ceases to be practical”. (p. 41, my translation)."

    "text": "2.4 Summary\nThis chapter explored science as a social system with a set of goals, norms, and a distribution of capital that together define the system’s structure. By looking at both the Mertonian and Bourdieusian perspectives, we can understand this system as one where agents are at the same time guided by institutional norms common to all and by their strategies aimed at improving their position in the field. We described some mechanisms through which the system recognizes and rewards researchers for their contributions, this recognition being the main driver of one’s ascension in the stratified structure of science. We also explored some factors that can distort these recognition mechanisms, such as the Matthew effect and the Mathilda effect. These remind us that, ultimately, recognition and reward are subjective processes.\nDespite their differences, Merton and Bourdieu’s theories have a lot in common, most importantly the principle of social stratification providing some researchers with an advantage over others. Furthermore, both theories highlight the importance of accumulating peer recognition (Merton 1957) or symbolic capital (Bourdieu 1987) for researchers. This recognition is mainly achieved by contributing to the advancement of knowledge and playing by the rules of the game, at least as long as one sees this as the best advancement strategy.\n\n\n\n\nBourdieu, Pierre. 1971. “Le Marché Des Biens Symboliques.” L’Année Sociologique 3 (22): 49–126. https://doi.org/10.2307/27887912.\n\n\n———. 1975. “The Specificity of the Scientific Field and the Social Conditions of the Progress of Reason.” Social Science Information 14 (6): 19–47. https://doi.org/10.1177/053901847501400602.\n\n\n———. 1979. “Les Trois États Du Capital Culturel.” Actes de La Recherche En Sciences Sociales 30 (1): 3–6. https://doi.org/10.3406/arss.1979.2654.\n\n\n———. 1980. “Le Capital Social.

    "text": "3.2 The organization of research\nToday’s research is largely done in universities, but it was not always so. Before the adoption of the Humboldt model of universities (as institutions of research and teaching) in Germany in the early 19th century and it’s subsequent generalization, research was mainly organized by academies, which initially operated like clubs funded by their members: an international group of science amateurs. I highlight the word amateur here since the professional status of the scientist as it is understood today is a relatively recent historical development.\nAlthough there is a stereotype of the scientist as a mad professor alone his laboratory, history shows that science has always been a collective effort. The first scientific societies – which were more like private clubs – were formed in the 1600s in some of Europe’s major cities. Most of these clubs evaluated research and technology on behalf of their monarch, such as The Royal Society of London, which is the oldest scientific academy to still exist today. Founded in 1660, the Royal Society became a publishing venue for scientific ideas and reports, and was critical in the formation of a scholarly communication network throughout Europe.\nAlso founded in 1660 was the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Unlike London’s Royal Society, which was not financially supported by the monarchy, the Paris academy awarded government stipends to a small group of scientists. These stipends helped legitimize science as a profession while drawing upon the vast resources of the kingdom, and by the 1700s, being elected to the Académie des Sciences carried great prestige and financial assurances. As with the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences paved the way for scientific publication by publishing proceedings from its meetings.\nDespite these scientists’ supposed interest in attaining enlightenment, they were as discriminatory as anybody else from back then, allowing mostly prominent citizens from noble families into these early societies. The first woman was admitted into the Royal Society as late as 1945. There’s no way to measure how much greater our knowledge would be if early scientific clubs had been open to all citizens.\nNonetheless, the emergence of the Royal Academy and the Académie des Sciences inspired other aspiring scientists throughout Europe. Societies became a crucial part of science, allowing researchers to coordinate and evaluate their efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Royal Society of London, you can check out their website: https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/\n\n\nThe institutionalization of science took place gradually over the last 2 centuries and greatly accelerated after World War I and World War II, which brought scientific development (which played a decisive role in the outcome of the war) to the forefront of national priorities. While the international scientific community had long existed and transcended geopolitical boundaries, governments came do realize the importance of developing a national research capacity to decrease their reliance on other countries for the production and application of new knowledge. This contributed to the massification of research and higher education, as well as the proliferation of universities and university professors, effectively operating a full transition from science as a hobby to science as a profession."

    "text": "3.2 Scholarly communications before scholarly journals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of the written work\n\n\n\nWritten works can be disseminated, copied, verified and referenced. they can contain detailed information, including images and figures. They establish priority in discoveries, can be used to generate a record of the scientific knowledge that does not die with the scientists.\n\n\nIf you have ever wondered what people did all day before the internet, you probably have the impression (maybe from Bridgerton) that they just wrote letters all day long. Thus, it is not surprising that the earliest scholarly communication took place through letter writing (“personal correspondence,” if you’re fancy.)\nScientists spread the news of observations and ongoing experiments through letters written to other scientists. Letters were a part of daily life due to their convenience, low cost, and lack of censorship. In the 17th century, letters could be sent across Europe within weeks – great speed for the time.\nHowever, even back then it was too much work to write a letter to each of your scientist friends announcing your most recent discovery. Instead, there were middlemen who collected and distributed these letters to other scientists. One of the most famous of these information gatekeepers was Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of London’s Royal Society. At Society meetings, Oldenburg would read aloud the correspondence he received that pertained to scientific matters. For example, the minutes of a Society meeting from 1667 reads as follows:\n\n“During the recess of the society Mr. OLDENBURG kept up his correspondences with several of the learned men abroad, and particularly HEVELIUS; the letters which passed between them being extent in the LetterBook….\nMr. OLDENBURG read an extract of Monsr. AUZOUT’s letter to him from Paris, Decemb. 28.1666. N.S. mentioning a new method esteemed by him better than any hitherto practised, of taking the diameters of the planets to seconds, and of knowing the parallax of the moon by means of her diameter.” (Fjällbrant 1997)\n\nThese meeting minutes show indications of an international scholarly communication network dating back to the 17th century.\nAnother prominent figure was Father Marin Mersenne, who was at the center of a correspondence network. By visualizing these networks, we are able to observe a part of what we could call the “scientific community” of the time."

    "text": "3.3 Scholarly journals\nEven though it was preceded by a few months by the Journal des Sçavans that eventually became the main dissemination platform of members of the Académie des Sciences, the Philosophical Transactions first published in 1665 by the Royal Society (and still published today) is generally referred to as the first scholarly journal. Its editor-in-chief was Harry Oldenburg. Eventually, these journals came to formalize and organize the process of dissemination of knowledge that had been before relying on informal networks and people like Father Mersenne.\n\n3.3.1 Organizing knowledge and research communities\nWith the growth of science came increased specialization, the creation of new disciplines, scholarly associations, and journals with varying degree of specialization, as well as national journals to accommodate the growth of national science systems that we mentioned above. In this way, journals play an important role in shaping and structuring research communities, and the knowledge that they produce.\n\n\n3.3.2 Quality control (peer review)\nAnother role of journals that may come to mind is the evaluation of research, which is done through a process known as peer review. Peer-review is one of the most central and defining feature of modern science and the scholarly communication process. It is directly related to the Mertonian norm of organized skepticism, and can be defined as “the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies as the producers of the work” (Wikipedia). One job of the journal editor or their team is to invite experts (typically two) to evaluate the article and determine if it is suitable for publication in the journal. The peer review process can be single-blind (the identify of the author known to the reviewer, but the reviewer is anonymous), double-blind (both the reviewer and the author remain anonymous), or open (the identities of all parties are revealed). In recent years, the idea of post-publication peer review has been gaining some steam. This type of peer review, as the name suggests, occurs only after the article is published (usually on some online platform), and is another form of open and transparent peer review. The main appeal of post-publication peer-review is that it allows for the faster dissemination of knowledge (with the traditional pre-publication peer review can take months or years before a submitted article eventually gets published). The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to the recent hype around post-publication peer-review. Since the world needed to have access to research results to do things like developing and approving vaccines. However, letting everyone publish their work before the peer review process occurs can have perverse effects, such as the potential flooding of the web with bad science. Peer review is a quality control mechanism, after all. This short article in Nature discusses some of the challenges encountered by pre-preprint servers bioRxiv.org during the pandemic: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01394-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nPeer review as it is conducted today (by external reviewers invited by the editor) is a relatively new thing in science. For hundreds of years following the creation of the Philosophical Transaction the journal editors were the ones who handled the quality control of the works they published. However, as science became more and more institutionalized and the number of researchers and research areas grew, it became impossible for editors to handle all that work. They could also not be expert in all the areas of research that their journals would publish. So, they turned to external reviewers for help.\nSome eminent researchers, like Albert Einstein, were not huge fans of this new process. When the Physical Review journal editor rejected one of his papers based on the external reviewers’ comments, this was Einstein’s response:\n\nDear Sir,\nWe (Mr. Rosen and I) had sent you our manuscript for publication and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed. I see no reason to address the—in any case erroneous—comments of your anonymous expert. On the basis of this incident I prefer to publish the paper elsewhere.\nRespectfully,\nP.S. Mr. Rosen, who has left for the Soviet Union, has authorized me to represent him in this matter.\n\nBy the way, the reviewer turned out to be right, and Einstein ended up correcting the paper before it was published in another journal.\n\n\nEven though peer review is now a standard and widely accepted element of the scholarly communication process, there are still a lot of researchers who are critical of the process. Here are some of the main critics of peer review.\n\nPeer review is arbitrary. The outcome of the peer review is difficult to predict and the same publication might receive a completely different assessment depending on the reviewers involved.\nPeer review is biased. There are all kinds of ways in which reviews may be biased, prominent scientists get more favorable reviews than those who are unknown. Gender, ethnicity, topics, methods, and innovativeness are all factors that may affect the outcome of the review in one way or another.\nPeer review does not detect error or fraud. In the last two decades, we have seen a surge in the retractions of peer reviewed articles that were found to be erroneous or fraudulent, leading some people to argue that the fact that these papers made it past peer review demonstrates that the process does not work.\nPeer review is exploitative. Peer review is performed voluntarily by members of the scientific community. It also provides little returns in symbolic capital for the reviewer. However, they help increase the quality and reputation of the journals, many of which are owned by corporations who extract large profits from the reputation of their journals.\nPeer review is slow. It may take time for an editor to find suitable reviewers for a paper. Then reviewers are given usually about a month for their review. Then the comments are sent to the authors who are invited to submit a response to the reviewers and an updated manuscript. This process is repeated until the manuscript gets accepted for publication. Here is a meme to illustrate just how slow peer review can be:\n\n\n\n.. (AcademicChatter?) #AcademicTwitter #phdlife #phdchat #ecrchat #acwri #AcademicChatter (WoeAcademia?) (AcaGrumbles?) pic.twitter.com/RAqLnvdFDT\n\n— Reviewer 2 ((GrumpyReviewer2?)) September 21, 2019\n\n\n\n3.3.2.1 Reviewer 2\nThis is probably a good time to introduce the dreaded and infamous reviewer 2. Indeed, if it takes such a long time for a paper to get published, it is a well-known fact that it is partly because of reviewer 2. But who is reviewer 2?\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone fears reviewer 2, but what they fear even more is being reviewer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nPeer review is not only a part of the scholarly communication process but occurs in almost all stages of the research process (e.g., research funding) and throughout the reward system of science (hiring, tenure, promotion, honorific awards, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Other uses (or misuses) of journals\n\n3.3.3.1 Research evaluation\nJournals having different levels of prestige (symbolic capital), they are often used as proxy for the quality of publications, researchers, and institutions. Publishing in some specific journals can be determinant and even make or break scientific careers, bring universities up in university rankings, etc. For example, the Financial Times produces a business schools ranking in which they use the number of articles published in 50 top journals as an indicator of research excellence.\nIn bibliometrics, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is one way in which the prestige of a journal is quantified and measured (based on average number of citations papers published in the journal have received). To appreciate the importance of a journal, one does not have to be a member of the community or be able to recognize the prominence of the editorial board members or the quality of the content published by the journal. One just needs to know 5 is a higher number than 4 and hang on to the belief that this number is a true representation of a journal’s quality or prestige, so that a journal with a JIF of 5 is better than a journal with a JIF of 4. By extension, a scientist who publishes their work in a journal with a JIF of 5 has to be a better scientist than one who publishes in a journal with a JIF of 4. This of course is a widely criticized use of the JIF, which were actually designed to help academic librarians with collection development, not to evaluate science or scientists.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Generating profits\nMost of the journals published today are owned by a handful of large corporations (Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015) that control what is one of the most profitable industries of modern times. This is done largely by selling back to the scientific community (mainly through academic libraries) the product of its free labor (research, peer-review). We will address this topic again in a later chapter about open access publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nThis article published in the Guardian is a fascinating dive into the recent history of the scholarly publishing industry and how it came to be one of the most profitable industry of modern times.\nThis blog post discusses the profits generated through the article processing charges (APCs) that publishers typically charge to make research articles openly accessible."
