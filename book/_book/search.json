    "text": "Today’s research is largely done in universities, but it was not always so. Before the adoption of the Humboldt model of universities (as institutions of research and teaching) in Germany in the early 19th century and its subsequent generalization, research was mainly organized by academies, which initially operated like clubs funded by their members: an international group of science amateurs. I highlight the word amateur here since the professional status of the scientist as it is understood today is a relatively recent historical development.\nAlthough there is a stereotype of the scientist as a mad professor alone his laboratory, history shows that science has always been a collective effort. The first scientific societies – which were more like private clubs – were formed in the 1600s in some of Europe’s major cities. Most of these clubs evaluated research and technology on behalf of their monarch, such as The Royal Society of London, which is the oldest scientific academy to still exist today. Founded in 1660, the Royal Society became a publishing venue for scientific ideas and reports, and was critical in the formation of a scholarly communication network throughout Europe.\nAlso founded in 1660 was the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Unlike London’s Royal Society, which was not financially supported by the monarchy, the Paris academy awarded government stipends to a small group of scientists. These stipends helped legitimize science as a profession while drawing upon the vast resources of the kingdom, and by the 1700s, being elected to the Académie des Sciences carried great prestige and financial assurances. As with the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences paved the way for scientific publication by publishing proceedings from its meetings.\nDespite these scientists’ supposed interest in attaining enlightenment, they were as discriminatory as anybody else from back then, allowing mostly prominent citizens from noble families into these early societies. The first woman was admitted into the Royal Society as late as 1945. There’s no way to measure how much greater our knowledge would be if early scientific clubs had been open to all citizens.\nNonetheless, the emergence of the Royal Academy and the Académie des Sciences inspired other aspiring scientists throughout Europe. Societies became a crucial part of science, allowing researchers to coordinate and evaluate their efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Royal Society of London, you can check out their website: https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/\n\n\nThe institutionalization of science took place gradually over the last 2 centuries and greatly accelerated after World War I and World War II, which brought scientific development (which played a decisive role in the outcome of the war) to the forefront of national priorities. While the international scientific community had long existed and transcended geopolitical boundaries, governments came to realize the importance of developing a national research capacity to decrease their reliance on other countries for the production and application of new knowledge. This contributed to the massification of research and higher education, as well as the proliferation of universities and university professors, effectively operating a full transition from science as a hobby to science as a profession."

(or scientific knowledge graph (SKG), which may be a better name since these databases generally include more than citations).\n\nThe indexing of citations, pioneered by Eugene Garfield in the 1960s, is the key innovation that led to the emergence and growth of bibliometrics as its own field of research over the last half-century. This chapter presents some of the main citation indexes that are available today and that support research evaluation and bibliometric research across the globe."

    "title": "2  The social structure of science",
    "section": "2.2 Mertonian framework",
    "text": "2.2 Mertonian framework\nMerton was a highly influential American sociologist who is said to have essentially created the modern sociology of science. For Merton, the institutional goal of science is the extension of certified knowledge, and the ethos of science comprises that goal and a set of norms that ensure its fulfillment. The following sections provide an overview of the part of his work, as well as the work of some of his students and close collaborators, through which they sought to understand the conditions under which science as a social system operates in accordance with the ethos of science and sometimes deviate from it.\n\n2.2.1 The norms of science\nMerton (1942) defined four norms of science which are binding to all scientists:\n\nCommunism: Science is a common good. This emphasizes the importance of the dissemination of discoveries, which is necessary for their inclusion in the common stock of knowledge.\nUniversalism: Contributions to the advancement of knowledge need to be judged for their own merit irrespective of the characteristics of the individuals or groups involved. Similarly, access to scientific careers must be based on relevant criteria and not sociodemographic characteristics or other irrelevant factors.\nDisinterestedness refers to the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and for the benefit of humankind, and not for personal gains. Scientists are characterized by a passion for knowledge, curiosity, and the desire to ameliorate the human condition. Merton emphasizes that if scientists, as a group, disproportionally exhibit these characteristics, it’s because the scientific system rewards disinterestedness and not so much because naturally disinterested people decide to become scientists.\nOrganized skepticism:This norm operates at two levels. First, the institution of science exercises a collective form of skepticism towards beliefs and truth claims and seeks to subject them to thorough examination and empirical validation. Second, every scientific contribution must be subjected to the unbiased scrutiny of peers before being accepted as such and incorporated into the common stock of scientific knowledge.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Reward system of science\nBecause of the norms of communism and disinterestedness, the motivation of researchers is the recognition they receive from their peers (Zuckerman 1977a). As J. R. Cole and Cole (1973) put it:\n\nBecause recognition is so important to scientists, there must be a reward system that identifies and honors scientific excellence wherever it is found. If a scientist desires to acquire “property”, he can only do so through recognition by the system, since there are no other legitimate ways to obtain property in science. (p. 46)\n\nBecause the role of researchers is to advance knowledge, the scientific community gradually developed a reward system through which those who best fulfill this role are compensated (Merton 1957). This system works well when those who deserve recognition receive it, and the most promising researchers are provided with the resources they need to realize their potential. According to Merton (1973) this benefits both the individual researchers and science as a whole.\nThe reward system comprises many reward mechanisms that form a hierarchy. For Merton (1957), the most permanent and prestigious form of institutionalized recognition in science is eponymic reward: the practice of attaching a researcher’s name to a discovery (e.g., Zipf law, Planck’s constant, or Copernican system), a field (Comte, father of sociology), or a period (e.g., the Freudian era, the Darwinian era). Other prestigious forms of reward include honorific awards like the Nobel prize, membership to academies of science, or other nobility titles. Those who receive such prestigious titles are often seen as the scientific elite and are at the top of the stratified social structure of science (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\nBecause there are limited spots at the top of the hierarchy, there are many researchers whose contributions may be just as extraordinary (if not more) than those of Nobel prize winners but are not awarded such honours (Merton 1968). The scientific community thus creates less prestigious awards and prizes to highlight these accomplishments. However, these are still few in number and only bestowed upon a minority of researchers (Zuckerman 1977b; S. Cole and Cole 1967). So again, there are other mechanisms to reward accomplished scientists, such as nomination to important positions in scientific institutions or as editors of scholarly journals. At the bottom of the hierarchy, visibility is the most basic form of scientific reward: being published and cited by peers (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\n\n\n2.2.3 Social stratification\nThe social stratification of science is a systematic effect of the differentiation and evaluation of researchers who are positioned in a structure that determines their access to resources and opportunities Merton (1968) based on their recognized contributions or potential. Prestigious institutions with more resources recruit Individuals with recognized potential which confers to these individuals (and to the institutions) a competitive advantage. And so does the stratified social structure of science take form through a mixture of self and social selection (Merton 1979). Through their contributions to science, the researchers will then accumulate power and authority, maintain or grow their advantage, and contribute to the asymmetric distribution of resources, productivity, visibility and prestige (J. R. Cole and Cole 1973).\n\n\n2.2.4 Accumulation of advantages and disadvantages\nThe social stratification of science can generate the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages by scientists, thus increasing the gap between the haves and the have-nots (Zuckerman 1998). Identifying promising researchers and providing them with a certain advantage has a short and long-term effect on their careers. When it is working optimally, the divide between the haves and the have-nots grows exponentially. The best performing researchers obtaining more resources, which they use to perform even better and in return obtain even more resources, and so on. According to Zuckerman (1998), the system would become dysfunctional if resource allocation were based on criteria that don’t relate to performance (e.g., gender, religion, ethnicity) or if resources were equally or randomly distributed. Overall, the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages contributes to the social stratification of science which, according to Zuckerman (1998), is essential for the optimization of the scientific system and the advancement of knowledge.\n\n2.2.4.1 Matthew effect\nThe value of a scientific contribution and the recognition that the researchers obtain in return is inevitably based on the subjective judgment of their peers, which can introduce some dysfunctions in the reward system, such as what Merton (1968) called the Matthew Effect, defined as “the accruing of greater increments of recognition for particular scientific contributions to scientists of considerable repute and the withholding of such recognition from scientists who have not yet made their mark” (p. 53). According to J. R. Cole and Cole (1973), the Matthew effect is a direct effect of the social stratification of science, which amplifies the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages by overestimating the merit of some researchers at the detriment of others. The Matthew effect occurs at many levels, such as the recognition of one’s accomplishments, in peer-review, awards, research funding and so on.\n\n\n2.2.4.2 Mathilda effect\nRossiter (1993) showed three decades ago that women in science tended to be disadvantaged by being deprived partly or totally of recognition for their scientific contributions. Like the Matthew effect, this violates the norm of universalism. Some of the most significant scientific discoveries made by women led to their male collaborators winning the Nobel Prize. Even if today the gap between men and women in science has narrowed, women remain less likely then men to obtain awards or important positions Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) and tend to be less cited (Larivière et al. 2013). It should be acknowledged here that these theories were developed before the generalized recognition of gender as a non-binary concept, and that the disadvantages discussed here have been shown to apply to minorities and equity-deserving groups more broadly. I should also mention here that still to this day, bibliometric studies tend to to operationalize gender as a binary concept, which is mostly due to the fact that bibliographic databases do not usually provide the gender of authors, and we must then rely on other available data like first names and geographical location to guess the gender of authors."

    "title": "2  The social structure of science",
    "section": "2.3 Bourdieusian framework",
    "text": "2.3 Bourdieusian framework\nWe now turn our attention to the theories developed by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, whose perspective on science is fundamentally different than Merton’s as it is centred not around a set of institutional goals and norms but around power struggles between pragmatic self-interested agents.\n\n2.3.1 Field and agents\nAccording to Bourdieu (1975), the social space is divided in several distinct fields that are relatively autonomous and have specific interests and stakes. Science can be understood as a field with the specific goal of advancing knowledge. The field is composed of agents that possess different forms of capital (discussed below) and can be defined as entities recognized by their peers and who internalize the goals and norms of the field. There are two key concepts in this definition. First, the concept of recognition here highlights that certain conditions must be met for an agent to integrate a field, and the concept of internalization, which is tied to the concept of habitus discussed further..\nThe structure of a field is determined by the relative position occupied by all of the agents in the field based on the type and amount of capital they possess. This structure is dynamic because agents within a field constantly compete and mobilize their capital to acquire more capital, increase their symbolic power, and dominate the field.\nThere are also meta-fields which have some degree of influence on many other fields. The state is an example of a meta-field since it can, to some degree, impose regulations on other fields and play an important role in distributing resources within fields (e.g., funding corporations and universities). Bourdieu’s theory also includes a field of power composed of agents with a lot of capital that they can use to gain influence in other fields. Think, for example, of movie stars who can mobilize that stardom to gain political influence.\nThe concept of sub-fields is also important. For instance, the scientific community is formed by a set of agents that share a goal (advancing knowledge), but it is also composed of many sub-fields with their own specific goals (e.g., the production of knowledge in a certain area), practices and norms. The existence of meta-fields and sub-fields highlights the limited autonomy of fields.\n\n\n2.3.2 Capital\nBourdieu’s theory of capital incorporates Durkheim’s concept of cultural capital and Marx’s concept of economic capital, to which it adds the concepts of social capital and symbolic capital. Every field also has its form of capital (e.g., scientific capital) that can only be acquired within the field and has limited utility outside it.\n\n2.3.2.1 Economic capital\nEconomic capital comprises an agent’s financial resources, material assets, revenues, and means of production. This capital can be transformed into other types of capital. For instance, in the scientific field, a researcher might invest various forms of economic capital (research funds, work, equipment) to produce a contribution to knowledge and thus obtain some scientific capital.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Social capital\nBourdieu (1980) defines social capital as resources available or potentially available to an agent by virtue of their belonging to a group, to a network of agents that recognize the links that unite them. The social capital of an agent is thus the extent of the network (number of nodes), the type and amount of capital that the connected agents possess, and the capacity of the agent to mobilize this capital. Social capital is acquired through efforts to create and maintain relationships through events (e.g., conferences), places (e.g., research laboratories), and practices (e.g., collaboration, peer review).\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Cultural capital\nAccording to Bourdieu (1979), cultural capital can be embodied, objectified, or institutionalized. Embodied cultural capital is the knowledge of an agent. Objectified cultural capital can be things like books, works of art, or musical instruments. Finally, an example of institutionalized cultural capital is a diploma. While agents may not recognize embodied capital within a field, diplomas and similar credentials can often guarantee a minimal degree of recognition within a field.\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Symbolic capital\nThe knowledge and recognition by agents of a field of the different forms of capital than an agent possesses confers symbolic capital to that agent Bourdieu (1987). Thus, symbolic capital is a form of meta-capital that is the supreme objective of agents’ actions in a field, as it is the recognition of one’s position within it. The distribution of symbolic capital ultimately determines the power structure at play in the field.\n\n\n2.3.2.5 Scientific capital\nScientific capital is a form of symbolic capital specific to the scientific field which determines its structure (Bourdieu 1975). It is the recognition by peers of one’s contribution to scientific progress (Bourdieu 1997). It provides its owner scientific authority and legitimacy in scientific matters. Scientific capital is provided by peers, which are also competitors. This is one of the most important features of science (peer review) and is related to the organized skepticism norm. Furthermore, not all contributions are equal, so the amount of scientific capital an agent may possess is determined by the value and originality of their contribution. The scientific article (or other forms of scholarly publications) materializes that contribution and is an example of what Bourdieu (1971) calls “symbolic goods”: objects that have some value in symbolic capital within a specific field.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Habitus\nThe habitus of an individual is their mental representation of the world and of their position and the position of others within it. It is the structure of the field in its embodied form Bourdieu (1989). Agents acquire the habitus of a specific field through learning and experience within it. Through this process, agents eventually recognize the goals, norms, and structure of the field and are thus able to invest their capital strategically. The field and the habitus are thus interdependent. The habitus is structured by the field of which it is an embodied form, but it also structures the field since it guides the action of agents, which alter the structure of the field.\nThe habitus produces some regularity in the action of agents because it is derived from an objective structure common to all. However, Bourdieu’s theory insists that agents are guided by pragmatism more than by norms or rules. As Bourdieu (1986) points out, “we must avoid seeing in agent’s behaviour more logic than there is, because the logic of pragmatism is to be logical to a point where being logical ceases to be practical”. (p. 41, my translation)."

    "text": "2.4 Summary\nThis chapter explored science as a social system with a set of goals, norms, and a distribution of capital that together define the system’s structure. By looking at both the Mertonian and Bourdieusian perspectives, we can understand this system as one where agents are at the same time guided by institutional norms common to all and by their strategies aimed at improving their position in the field. We described some mechanisms through which the system recognizes and rewards researchers for their contributions, this recognition being the main driver of one’s ascension in the stratified structure of science. We also explored some factors that can distort these recognition mechanisms, such as the Matthew effect and the Mathilda effect. These remind us that, ultimately, recognition and reward are subjective processes.\nDespite their differences, Merton and Bourdieu’s theories have a lot in common, most importantly the principle of social stratification providing some researchers with an advantage over others. Furthermore, both theories highlight the importance of accumulating peer recognition (Merton 1957) or symbolic capital (Bourdieu 1987) for researchers. This recognition is mainly achieved by contributing to the advancement of knowledge and playing by the rules of the game, at least as long as one sees this as the best advancement strategy.\n\n\n\n\nBourdieu, Pierre. 1971. “Le Marché Des Biens Symboliques.” L’Année Sociologique 3 (22): 49–126. https://doi.org/10.2307/27887912.\n\n\n———. 1975. “The Specificity of the Scientific Field and the Social Conditions of the Progress of Reason.” Social Science Information 14 (6): 19–47. https://doi.org/10.1177/053901847501400602.\n\n\n———. 1979. “Les Trois États Du Capital Culturel.” Actes de La Recherche En Sciences Sociales 30 (1): 3–6. https://doi.org/10.3406/arss.1979.2654.\n\n\n———. 1980. “Le Capital Social.

    "text": "3.2 The organization of research\nToday’s research is largely done in universities, but it was not always so. Before the adoption of the Humboldt model of universities (as institutions of research and teaching) in Germany in the early 19th century and it’s subsequent generalization, research was mainly organized by academies, which initially operated like clubs funded by their members: an international group of science amateurs. I highlight the word amateur here since the professional status of the scientist as it is understood today is a relatively recent historical development.\nAlthough there is a stereotype of the scientist as a mad professor alone his laboratory, history shows that science has always been a collective effort. The first scientific societies – which were more like private clubs – were formed in the 1600s in some of Europe’s major cities. Most of these clubs evaluated research and technology on behalf of their monarch, such as The Royal Society of London, which is the oldest scientific academy to still exist today. Founded in 1660, the Royal Society became a publishing venue for scientific ideas and reports, and was critical in the formation of a scholarly communication network throughout Europe.\nAlso founded in 1660 was the Académie des Sciences in Paris. Unlike London’s Royal Society, which was not financially supported by the monarchy, the Paris academy awarded government stipends to a small group of scientists. These stipends helped legitimize science as a profession while drawing upon the vast resources of the kingdom, and by the 1700s, being elected to the Académie des Sciences carried great prestige and financial assurances. As with the Royal Society, the Académie des Sciences paved the way for scientific publication by publishing proceedings from its meetings.\nDespite these scientists’ supposed interest in attaining enlightenment, they were as discriminatory as anybody else from back then, allowing mostly prominent citizens from noble families into these early societies. The first woman was admitted into the Royal Society as late as 1945. There’s no way to measure how much greater our knowledge would be if early scientific clubs had been open to all citizens.\nNonetheless, the emergence of the Royal Academy and the Académie des Sciences inspired other aspiring scientists throughout Europe. Societies became a crucial part of science, allowing researchers to coordinate and evaluate their efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested reading\n\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Royal Society of London, you can check out their website: https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/\n\n\nThe institutionalization of science took place gradually over the last 2 centuries and greatly accelerated after World War I and World War II, which brought scientific development (which played a decisive role in the outcome of the war) to the forefront of national priorities. While the international scientific community had long existed and transcended geopolitical boundaries, governments came do realize the importance of developing a national research capacity to decrease their reliance on other countries for the production and application of new knowledge. This contributed to the massification of research and higher education, as well as the proliferation of universities and university professors, effectively operating a full transition from science as a hobby to science as a profession."

    "text": "3.2 Scholarly communications before scholarly journals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of the written work\n\n\n\nWritten works can be disseminated, copied, verified and referenced. they can contain detailed information, including images and figures. They establish priority in discoveries, can be used to generate a record of the scientific knowledge that does not die with the scientists.\n\n\nIf you have ever wondered what people did all day before the internet, you probably have the impression (maybe from Bridgerton) that they just wrote letters all day long. Thus, it is not surprising that the earliest scholarly communication took place through letter writing (“personal correspondence,” if you’re fancy.)\nScientists spread the news of observations and ongoing experiments through letters written to other scientists. Letters were a part of daily life due to their convenience, low cost, and lack of censorship. In the 17th century, letters could be sent across Europe within weeks – great speed for the time.\nHowever, even back then it was too much work to write a letter to each of your scientist friends announcing your most recent discovery. Instead, there were middlemen who collected and distributed these letters to other scientists. One of the most famous of these information gatekeepers was Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of London’s Royal Society. At Society meetings, Oldenburg would read aloud the correspondence he received that pertained to scientific matters. For example, the minutes of a Society meeting from 1667 reads as follows:\n\n“During the recess of the society Mr. OLDENBURG kept up his correspondences with several of the learned men abroad, and particularly HEVELIUS; the letters which passed between them being extent in the LetterBook….\nMr. OLDENBURG read an extract of Monsr. AUZOUT’s letter to him from Paris, Decemb. 28.1666. N.S. mentioning a new method esteemed by him better than any hitherto practised, of taking the diameters of the planets to seconds, and of knowing the parallax of the moon by means of her diameter.” (Fjällbrant 1997)\n\nThese meeting minutes show indications of an international scholarly communication network dating back to the 17th century.\nAnother prominent figure was Father Marin Mersenne, who was at the center of a correspondence network. By visualizing these networks, we are able to observe a part of what we could call the “scientific community” of the time."

    "section": "3.3 Scholarly journals",
    "text": "3.3 Scholarly journals\nEven though it was preceded by a few months by the Journal des Sçavans that eventually became the main dissemination platform of members of the Académie des Sciences, the Philosophical Transactions first published in 1665 by the Royal Society (and still published today) is generally referred to as the first scholarly journal. Its editor-in-chief was Harry Oldenburg. Eventually, these journals came to formalize and organize the process of dissemination of knowledge that had been before relying on informal networks and people like Father Mersenne.\n\n3.3.1 Organizing knowledge and research communities\nWith the growth of science came increased specialization, the creation of new disciplines, scholarly associations, and journals with varying degree of specialization, as well as national journals to accommodate the growth of national science systems that we mentioned above. In this way, journals play an important role in shaping and structuring research communities, and the knowledge that they produce.\n\n\n3.3.2 Quality control (peer review)\nAnother role of journals that may come to mind is the evaluation of research, which is done through a process known as peer review. Peer-review is one of the most central and defining feature of modern science and the scholarly communication process. It is directly related to the Mertonian norm of organized skepticism, and can be defined as “the evaluation of work by one or more people with similar competencies as the producers of the work” (Wikipedia). One job of the journal editor or their team is to invite experts (typically two) to evaluate the article and determine if it is suitable for publication in the journal. The peer review process can be single-blind (the identify of the author known to the reviewer, but the reviewer is anonymous), double-blind (both the reviewer and the author remain anonymous), or open (the identities of all parties are revealed). In recent years, the idea of post-publication peer review has been gaining some steam. This type of peer review, as the name suggests, occurs only after the article is published (usually on some online platform), and is another form of open and transparent peer review. The main appeal of post-publication peer-review is that it allows for the faster dissemination of knowledge (with the traditional pre-publication peer review can take months or years before a submitted article eventually gets published). The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to the recent hype around post-publication peer-review. Since the world needed to have access to research results to do things like developing and approving vaccines. However, letting everyone publish their work before the peer review process occurs can have perverse effects, such as the potential flooding of the web with bad science. Peer review is a quality control mechanism, after all. This short article in Nature discusses some of the challenges encountered by pre-preprint servers bioRxiv.org during the pandemic: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01394-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nPeer review as it is conducted today (by external reviewers invited by the editor) is a relatively new thing in science. For hundreds of years following the creation of the Philosophical Transaction the journal editors were the ones who handled the quality control of the works they published. However, as science became more and more institutionalized and the number of researchers and research areas grew, it became impossible for editors to handle all that work. They could also not be expert in all the areas of research that their journals would publish. So, they turned to external reviewers for help.\nSome eminent researchers, like Albert Einstein, were not huge fans of this new process. When the Physical Review journal editor rejected one of his papers based on the external reviewers’ comments, this was Einstein’s response:\n\nDear Sir,\nWe (Mr. Rosen and I) had sent you our manuscript for publication and had not authorized you to show it to specialists before it is printed. I see no reason to address the—in any case erroneous—comments of your anonymous expert. On the basis of this incident I prefer to publish the paper elsewhere.\nRespectfully,\nP.S. Mr. Rosen, who has left for the Soviet Union, has authorized me to represent him in this matter.\n\nBy the way, the reviewer turned out to be right, and Einstein ended up correcting the paper before it was published in another journal.\n\n\nEven though peer review is now a standard and widely accepted element of the scholarly communication process, there are still a lot of researchers who are critical of the process. Here are some of the main critics of peer review.\n\nPeer review is arbitrary. The outcome of the peer review is difficult to predict and the same publication might receive a completely different assessment depending on the reviewers involved.\nPeer review is biased. There are all kinds of ways in which reviews may be biased, prominent scientists get more favorable reviews than those who are unknown. Gender, ethnicity, topics, methods, and innovativeness are all factors that may affect the outcome of the review in one way or another.\nPeer review does not detect error or fraud. In the last two decades, we have seen a surge in the retractions of peer reviewed articles that were found to be erroneous or fraudulent, leading some people to argue that the fact that these papers made it past peer review demonstrates that the process does not work.\nPeer review is exploitative. Peer review is performed voluntarily by members of the scientific community. It also provides little returns in symbolic capital for the reviewer. However, they help increase the quality and reputation of the journals, many of which are owned by corporations who extract large profits from the reputation of their journals.\nPeer review is slow. It may take time for an editor to find suitable reviewers for a paper. Then reviewers are given usually about a month for their review. Then the comments are sent to the authors who are invited to submit a response to the reviewers and an updated manuscript. This process is repeated until the manuscript gets accepted for publication. Here is a meme to illustrate just how slow peer review can be:\n\n\n\n.. (AcademicChatter?) #AcademicTwitter #phdlife #phdchat #ecrchat #acwri #AcademicChatter (WoeAcademia?) (AcaGrumbles?) pic.twitter.com/RAqLnvdFDT\n\n— Reviewer 2 ((GrumpyReviewer2?)) September 21, 2019\n\n\n\n3.3.2.1 Reviewer 2\nThis is probably a good time to introduce the dreaded and infamous reviewer 2. Indeed, if it takes such a long time for a paper to get published, it is a well-known fact that it is partly because of reviewer 2. But who is reviewer 2?\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone fears reviewer 2, but what they fear even more is being reviewer 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\n\nPeer review is not only a part of the scholarly communication process but occurs in almost all stages of the research process (e.g., research funding) and throughout the reward system of science (hiring, tenure, promotion, honorific awards, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Other uses (or misuses) of journals\n\n3.3.3.1 Research evaluation\nJournals having different levels of prestige (symbolic capital), they are often used as proxy for the quality of publications, researchers, and institutions. Publishing in some specific journals can be determinant and even make or break scientific careers, bring universities up in university rankings, etc. For example, the Financial Times produces a business schools ranking in which they use the number of articles published in 50 top journals as an indicator of research excellence.\nIn bibliometrics, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is one way in which the prestige of a journal is quantified and measured (based on average number of citations papers published in the journal have received). To appreciate the importance of a journal, one does not have to be a member of the community or be able to recognize the prominence of the editorial board members or the quality of the content published by the journal. One just needs to know 5 is a higher number than 4 and hang on to the belief that this number is a true representation of a journal’s quality or prestige, so that a journal with a JIF of 5 is better than a journal with a JIF of 4. By extension, a scientist who publishes their work in a journal with a JIF of 5 has to be a better scientist than one who publishes in a journal with a JIF of 4. This of course is a widely criticized use of the JIF, which were actually designed to help academic librarians with collection development, not to evaluate science or scientists.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Generating profits\nMost of the journals published today are owned by a handful of large corporations (Larivière, Haustein, and Mongeon 2015) that control what is one of the most profitable industries of modern times. This is done largely by selling back to the scientific community (mainly through academic libraries) the product of its free labor (research, peer-review). We will address this topic again in a later chapter about open access publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested readings\n\n\n\nThis article published in the Guardian is a fascinating dive into the recent history of the scholarly publishing industry and how it came to be one of the most profitable industry of modern times.\nThis blog post discusses the profits generated through the article processing charges (APCs) that publishers typically charge to make research articles openly accessible."

The main ones generally used in bibliometric research are the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI).\nBecause it’s been around so long, the Web of Science (and because Elsevier was not making its database available for large-scale research until very recently) the Web of Science has long been the main database used for large scale bibliometric studies.\nIts main advantages are its long coverage period (although the competitors are catching up), the consistency of its metadata, and the clear criteria for the inclusion of sources in the database. (you can read about the editorial selection process here). However, the Web of Science’s focus on quality and consistency makes it one of the databases with the lowest coverage among its competitors.\nIf you’re interested in what a citation index looked like before the internet, I recommend the three videos below, produced by the ISI in 1967.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb of Science is not available at Dalhousie\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the Dalhousie Libraries do not have a subscription to the Web of Science, so you will not be able to use it as a data source for the course."

    "text": "6.3 Functions of authorship\nAccording to Birnholtz (2006), the functions of authorship in science are to assign credit, ownership, and responsibility for discoveries, as well as to enable the existence of a reputation economy.\n\n6.3.1 Credit\nAs we have seen, peer recognition is the main reward obtained by researchers, this symbolic capital then allowing them to obtain other rewards with symbolic but also financial value. It is therefore important for researchers to obtain this credit for their contributions and the codes of ethics of disciplinary associations (and, to a lesser extent, the editorial policies of journals) emphasize the importance of giving all contributors the credit due to them. To take up some elements of the theory of Bourdieu presented earlier, the credit is in fact the symbolic capital obtained by the researchers in their struggle for domination of the scientific field (Bourdieu, 1976). It is thanks to the status of authorship that the system of recognition of science can function, granting a form institutionalized credit (in the form of honorary awards, positions, for example) to researchers who have distinguished themselves as authors of important contributions to the advancement knowledge.\n\n\n6.3.2 Ownership and responsibility\nThe notion of ownership linked to authorship applies less to science than to other domains (e.g. the literary domain). Indeed, property rights in science boil down to recognition of the researcher’s contribution to the reported results (Merton, 1957). According Biagioli (2003), only the original expression of scientific discoveries, generally under textual form, is the property of the authors, which allows them to be protected against plagiarism. The notion of responsibility goes hand in hand with that of ownership and has a particular in science (Birnholtz, 2006; Rennie and Flanagin, 1994). In a system of recognition based on the contribution of researchers to the advancement of knowledge, the good functioning of the system depends on both its ability to reward merit and respect standards and its ability to punish, or at least not reward, demerit and non-compliance with standards. Scientific fraud (e.g. fabrication or falsification of scientific results research, or plagiarism) is an example of non-compliance with the standards of science having a negative impact on the career of the researchers involved (Azoulay, Bonatti and Krieger, 2015; Lu, Jin, Uzzi and Jones, 2013; Mongeon and Larivière, 2016), their institutions and even all their discipline (Azoulay, Furman, Krieger and Murray, 2015). Although they remain relatively rare compared to all scientific research, cases of fraud scientists have greatly increased over the last twenty years (Steen, Casadevall and Fang, 2013). This has contributed to publishers’ interest in developing guidelines on the attribution of the status of author which, as we will see later, particularly emphasis on the responsibility of researchers for the validity of the content of articles (Resnik and Masters, 2011).\n\n\n6.3.3 Reputation economy\nThe notions of reputation and the economics of reputation (Whitley, 2000) are closely linked to that of symbolic capital. Indeed, authorship, among other things, provides from scientific capital to the researcher (Birnholtz, 2006). Insofar as this capital is known and recognized by other researchers, it is converted into symbolic capital and thus confers on the seeking a certain power in the field (Bourdieu, 1987). The economy of reputation is also evident in the social stratification of the scientific field as well as at all levels of the hierarchy of rewards, from the simple citation to obtaining the Nobel Prize, form institutionalized symbolic capital and reputation of the researcher (Cole and Cole, 1973)."

    "section": "6.4 Authorship norms and practices in a collaborative context",
    "text": "6.4 Authorship norms and practices in a collaborative context\nResearch is an increasingly collaborative activity, in all disciplines the average number of authors in each disciplines increased continuously over the last century (Larivière et al., 2015; Wuchty et al., 2007). There are many factors explaining that trend, including the fact that research is more complex and expensive, leading researchers to pool together there expertise and resources (Katz and Martin 1997).\nAssigning authorship can be difficult when they are the outcome of the work of many individuals with different status, role and contributions. Decisions have to be made about 1) who will be an author (not all contributions lead to authorship) and 2) the order of the names, which is usually meant to indicate what share of the credit each one deserves (D. Pontille 2006). It can be extremely difficult for an external observer to determine who did what or what share of credit everyone deserves (Rennie et al., 1997).\nUtlimately, the byline depends of two elements:\n\nThe nature of the collaboration and the division of labour between members of the team(who did what?)\nThe decisions made about naming and ordering authors (who will be an author, and in what order will the names be listed\n\n\n6.4.1 Collaboration and division of labour\nLaudel (2002) identified six types de collaboration related to the types of contributions that individuals can make to a given research project:\n\nCollaboration involving a division of intellectual labour. Collaborators with a shared goal who make substantial intellectual contribution towards that goal. They are to some degree co-leading the research.\nService collaboration. Researchers who are called upon to produce routine work that require a specific expertise.\nProvision of access to research equipment. The collaborator does not perform any tasks related to the project but provides material, equipment, data, etc. used for the research.\nTransmission of know-how. The non-creative transmission of information stored in memory that is useful for the research.\nMutual stimulation: The stimulation and engagement through informal interactions that helps researchers develop their ideas.\nTrusted assessorship:Providing feedback on the work.\n\nNot all these forms of collaboration lead to authorship. Laudel (2002) found that authorship is usually attributed to collaborators of the first two types only.\nSubramanyam (1983) proposed four types of collaboration related to the hierarchical status of the involved individuals:\n\nSame-status collaborations.\nProfessor-student collaborations.\nSupervisor-assistant collaborations.\nResearcher-consultant collaborations.\n\nThe number of people required for a given project can have an influence on the types of collaboration that will take place. According to Walsh and Lee (2015), larger teams tend to lead to more bureaucratic organizational structures, which is characterized by increased division of labour, specialization and standardization of tasks, hierarchical relationships, and decentralized decision-making (Walsh et Lee, 2015).\nLes formes de collaboration privilégiées par les chercheurs ne sont pas seulement déterminées par leurs préférences personnelles, mais aussi par la nature des travaux de recherche effectués. Celle-ci est définie par l'objectif institutionnel de production de connaissances dont découlent des impératifs techniques et moraux (Merton, 1942). Cet objectif commun ou, selon Bourdieu (1976), les intérêts des agents dominants définissent les enjeux scientifiques (les objets de recherche) qui sont d'intérêts pour les agents du champ qui recherchent les investissements les plus payants en capital symbolique (Bourdieu, 1976). L'objet de recherche définit les ressources humaines et matérielles ainsi que les savoirs et savoir-faire requis, ce qui peut en quelque sorte imposer aux chercheurs certains types de collaboration et de division du travail. Cette idée est bien illustrée par la notion de culture épistémique (Knorr Cetina, 1999) qui désigne la particularité des pratiques de création des connaissances dans une discipline.\n\n\n6.4.2 Naming authors\nUnlike the concept of author in literature, which is linked with writing, the concept of author in science is not and other forms of contributions can lead to authorship. Moreover, as D. Pontille (2006) points out, the act of writing is not necessarily sufficient to obtain the author status, and it is also possible to be an author without writing. So what kind of contributions do lead to authorship? Contributions involving the division of intellectual labour (first type of collaboration identified by Laudel (2002)). This linked between the substantial intellectual contribution and authorship generates little to no debate in the literature. However, whether authorship should be awarded to individuals with technical, routine, or less substantial contributions is not so clear.\nHagstrom (1964) tackles the question of authorship for technical contributions by looking at the historical context and distinguishing traditional collaboration from modern collaboration. He portrays the traditional technician as having little qualifications and being involved in the search for solutions to scientific problems but performing simple tasks designed and assigned by the scientist in exchange for economic capital. In contrast, the modern technician is a qualified professional performing complex tasks that the researcher employing them may not know how to perform themselves. This professionalization of the technician is nicely illustrated by Knorr-Cetina (1999) who tells the story of an established researcher who mastered the theories of his field but was unable to execute the technical tasks their research required. This type of relationship between the scientist and the technician is not generalized and technical contributions do not always lead to authorship today Laudel (2002).\nThe type of contribution is not always the only determinant. The same task performed by a paid technician or by another researcher may lead to authorship for the latter but not the former Shibayama, Walsh, and Baba (2012).\nThe importance of a discovery can also affect authorship attribution. Jabbehdari et Walsh (2017) found that the individuals who performed technical or less subtantial contributions are more often excluded from the byline of highly cited work.\nThe relationship between the nature and extent of a contribution and authorship is also determined by implicit disciplinary norms. Some type of contributions that often lead to authorship in a discipline may not (and may even be considered unethical) in another (Bozeman and Youtie 2016). For example, in Sociology, writing remains one of the most important contribution and tends to be required to be an author David. Pontille (2004). However, Pontille distinguishes French Sociology from American Sociology, where authorship norms are more inclusive. This highlights that the disciplinary context is not entirely independent from the local context. In physics, we find the special case of mega collaborations leading to articles signed by hundreds (or thousands) of authors; a phenomena that Cronin (2001) calls “hyperauthorsip”. In this context, it is the affiliation to the collective, and not a specific contribution to the publication, that justifies authorship Knorr-Cetina (1999).\n\n6.4.2.1 Guest and ghost authors\nDans certains cas, il peut exister une relation très faible, voire inexistante entre la contribution effectuée et l'obtention du statut d'auteur. Il est fréquent, par exemple, que des auteurs honorifiques (guest ou honorary authors) signent des articles alors que leur contribution était très superficielle ou encore nulle, alors que d'autres, les auteurs fantômes (ghost authors), ne signent pas alors qu'ils ont réalisé une partie importante du travail (Bates, Anić, Marušić et Marušić, 2004; Flanagin et al., 1998; Godlee, 1996; Huth, 1986b; Katz et Martin, 2007; Mowatt et al., 2002; Sismondo, 2009; Wager, 2007a; Wislar, Flanagin, Fontanarosa et Deangelis, 2011).\n\n\n6.4.2.2 Acknowledgements\nDe plus, il est fréquent que les individus ainsi exclus de la liste des auteurs soient remerciés dans l'article (Cronin et Overfelt, 1994; Laudel, 2002). Les différences disciplinaires observées dans le nombre d'auteurs moyen par article sont d'ailleurs grandement réduites lorsqu'on tient compte à la fois des auteurs et des individus remerciés (Paul-Hus et al., 2017), ce qui suggère que ces différences ne découlent pas seulement du nombre de chercheurs ayant contribué à la recherche, mais peut-être aussi de différences disciplinaires dans les pratiques d'attribution du statut d'auteur, possiblement en ce qui concerne la valorisation des contributions des techniciens ou des assistants de recherche. Il importe ici de souligner la distinction entre l'auteur fantôme et le remercié. Le premier désigne l'individu qui n'a pas obtenu le statut d'auteur alors que sa contribution aurait normalement justifié une telle reconnaissance. Les remerciements sont plutôt utilisés, en principe, pour souligner une contribution dont l'ampleur ne justifie pas l'attribution du statut d'auteur (Kassirer et Angell, 1991). L'existence des auteurs honorifiques, des auteurs fantômes et des contributeurs remerciés met en évidence le fait que la liste des auteurs peut dans certains cas mener à une sous-estimation (Moulopoulos, Sideris et Georgilis, 1983; Paul-Hus, Mongeon, Sainte-Marie et Larivière, 2017; Rennie et Flanagin, 1994) ou à une surestimation (King, 2000) du nombre de chercheurs ayant contribué à une recherche.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Ordering authors\nAuthorship decisions are not only about who will be an author but also in what order the names will be listed, which is usually intended to reflect the importance of individual contributions to the work (Zuckerman 1968). In this section, we survey ordering approaches used in science.\n\n6.4.3.1 Alphabetical order\nAlphabetical order is sometimes used to distribute credit equally between members of the research team. It is also standard practice in some fields like Mathematics and Economics. This mode of ordering is also often used in hyperauthorship situations where the specific individual contributions are difficult to capture and order Knorr-Cetina (1999). Sometimes the authors will be grouped by institution or country first, and then ordered alphabetically within each group. The use of alphabetical in some cases but not always can generate some ambiguity since the first (or last) authors might be perceived has having made more important contributions than others even if that is not the case. Furthermore, it is possible for alphabetical order to occur by chance, sending a signal that authors may have contributed equally despite it not being the case (Zuckerman 1968).\n\n\n6.4.3.2 Decreasing order of contribution importance\nAuthors can also be listed based on the importance of their contribution, the first authors having typically contributed the most. This is a dominant mode of name ordering in Social Sciences and Humanities where writing is key (David. Pontille 2004). One limitation of this approach is that there is only one author at any position in the list. This issue is sometimes addressed by adding a note in the byline indicating that some authors contributed equally to the work (Hu 2009). According to Zuckerman (1967), prominent researchers sometimes let there less well-known collaborators take first authorship even if they may have contributed less.\n\n\n6.4.3.3 From the outside in\nUne variante de l'ordre basé sur la contribution décrit au paragraphe précédent est souvent utilisée dans certaines disciplines des sciences naturelles ou biomédicales où le travail de recherche s'effectue typiquement dans des laboratoires. La différence est que les deux extrémités de la liste des auteurs (la première et la dernière position) sont les plus importantes (Pontille, 2004, 2006). Le premier auteur, qui est généralement un doctorant ou un chercheur postdoctoral responsable de l'expérimentation. Le dernier auteur est généralement le directeur du laboratoire; celui qui détient l'autorité. Les autres contributeurs sont listés entre ces deux extrêmes en fonction de l'importance de leur contribution. Les contributions les moins importantes se retrouvant au centre de la liste (Pontille, 2004, 2006).\n\n\n6.4.3.4 Hybrid (partial alphabetical order)\nZuckerman (1968) décrit un dernier type d'ordonnancement que nous appellerons « ordre alphabétique partiel » et selon lequel un sous-ensemble des auteurs est en ordre alphabétique afin de mettre en évidence la contribution particulière d'un auteur (normalement le premier ou le dernier). Cette idée a été reprise par Mongeon et al. (2017) qui ont mesuré la prévalence des cas où seul un sous-ensemble des auteurs situés au centre de la liste est en ordre alphabétique. L'ordre alphabétique est ici utilisé pour créer une distinction entre les auteurs principaux (au début de la liste), les auteurs ayant joué un rôle de supervision (à la fin de la liste) et les autres (au milieu de la liste, en ordre alphabétique), dont la contribution est généralement moindre (Mongeon et al., 2017). Bien que les modes d'ordonnancement des auteurs présentés ci-dessus soient les plus fréquemment utilisés, il arrive aussi que les chercheurs utilisent d'autres critères, parfois arbitraires ou ludiques, pour déterminer l'ordre des auteurs (Cabanac, 2015).\n\n\n\n6.4.4 Categorizing authors\nCertains auteurs ont proposé de diviser les auteurs en trois groupes. Par exemple, Perneger et al. (2017) ont analysé les contributions individuelles des auteurs de 1139 articles du domaine biomédical et distingué trois types de profils : 1) le penseur (thinker), qui conçoit l'étude, obtient le financement, et révise l'article, 2) le soldat, qui fournit du matériel, du soutien administratif ou technique, ou participe à la collecte des données, et 3) le scribe, qui analyse et interprète les résultats et rédige l'article. De leur côté, Baerlocher, Newton, Gautam, Tomlinson et Detsky (2007) distinguent les trois types d'auteurs suivants :\n1. Les auteurs principaux (primary) : ils participent à la planification et à la réalisation de l'étude ainsi qu'à la rédaction de l'article. Ils sont en mesure d'expliquer l'ensemble des résultats de l'étude, et se portent garants de l'exactitude des informations rapportées dans l'article. Ils apparaissent généralement au début de la liste des auteurs.\n2. Les auteurs seniors/superviseurs (senior/supervisory) : ils participent à la planification et à la supervision de l'étude ainsi qu'à la révision substantielle de l'article. Comme les auteurs principaux, ils sont en mesure d'expliquer l'ensemble des résultats de l'étude et se portent aussi garants de l'exactitude des informations rapportées dans l'article. Ils apparaissent généralement à la fin de la liste des auteurs.\n3. Les auteurs contributeurs (contributing): Ils ont fait une contribution substantielle à la recherche, mais ils ne remplissent pas les critères pour l'obtention du statut d'auteur principal ou superviseur décrit ci-dessus. Ils n'ont pas à être en mesure d'expliquer l'ensemble des résultats de l'étude et ne sont pas responsables de l'exactitude des informations rapportées dans l'article. Ils apparaissent généralement au milieu de la liste des auteurs.\nUn parallèle peut être fait entre les typologies de Perneger et al. (2017) et de Baerlocher et al. (2007), les scribes s'apparentant aux auteurs principaux, les penseurs aux auteurs superviseurs, et les soldats aux auteurs contributeurs. De plus, les soldats et les auteurs contributeurs s'apparentent aux techniciens auxquels font référence Shapin (1989) et Hagstrom (1964), entre autres. Il est important toutefois de noter que le technicien selon la définition de Hagstrom (1964) est typiquement un salarié n'ayant pas d'intérêt dans les enjeux scientifiques, alors que les soldats et les auteurs contributeurs peuvent être d'autres chercheurs impliqués dans ce que Laudel (2002) appelle une collaboration de service."

    "text": "6.4 Authorship guidelines\nScholarly societies and journal editors have developed authorship guidelines in response to the lack of standards in authorship practices (Osborne and Holland 2009), the increased number of authors on articles, and the increase in cases of scientific misconduct Steen (2011) bringing forth the relationship between authorship and responsibility (Rennie and Flanagin 1994). Large research teams are most frequent in Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Health Sciences (Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007), and misconduct is most frequent in the Health Sciences (Fang, Steen, and Casadevall 2012). It is thus not surprising that these are research areas where authorship guidelines are frequently found Wager (2007).\nJournals rarely create their own authorship guidelines. Instead, they refer to the code of ethics of professional associations or publishers’ guidelines, which tend to refer to the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The ICMJE recommendations include four criteria that must be met by all authors of a paper:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content;\nFinal approval of the version to be published;\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nEven though there adoption is not generalized even in the Medical field (Bošnjak and Marušić 2012) these recommendation have a wide influence beyond this field. For instane, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the European Association of Science Editors (EASE), and major publishers like Elsevier, Springer-Nature, and Wiley-Blackwell refer to it.\nDespite the existence of these guidelines, there is no consensus on what constitutes a substantial contribution that should lead to authorship (Claxton 2005). Even when they do mention the type of tasks that matter for authorship, guidelines remain vague regarding the magnitude of the contribution required, simply stating that it should be substantial. Editors themselves are not convinced of the efficacy of the guidelines for reducing practices like guest and ghost authorship (Wager 2009). In sum, while guidelines might be able to help research teams with their authorship decisions, they seem to have a limited effect on these practices, and to be unable to address unethical authorship issues."

    "text": "6.2 The functions of scientific authorship\nAccording to Birnholtz (2006), the functions of authorship in science are to assign credit, ownership, and responsibility for discoveries, as well as to enable the existence of a reputation economy.\n\n6.2.1 Credit\nPeer recognition is the main reward obtained by researchers; this symbolic capital then allows them to obtain other rewards with symbolic but also economic value. It is therefore important for researchers to obtain this credit for their contributions and the codes of ethics of disciplinary associations (and, to a lesser extent, the editorial policies of journals) emphasize the importance of giving all contributors the credit due to them. It is thanks to authorship that the system of recognition of science can function, by granting an institutionalized form of credit (awards and positions, for instance) to researchers who have made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge.\n\n\n6.2.2 Ownership and responsibility\nThe link between authorship and ownership applies less to science than to other domains (e.g. the literary domain), because of the Mertonian norm of disinterestedness. According to Biagioli et al. (2003), only the original expression of scientific discoveries, generally under textual form, is the property of the authors, which grants them protection against plagiarism. Responsibility, which can be considered the other side of the ownership coin, has more relevance in science. The proper functioning of the scientific reward system relies on its ability to reward those who contribute to the goal and follow the norms, and its ability to punish (or at least not reward) those who act against the goals and norms of the system. Scientific fraud (e.g. fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism) is an example of non-compliance with the standards of science having a negative impact on the career of the researchers involved (Mongeon 2015), and even on their institutions and their disciplines (Azoulay et al. 2015). Although they remain relatively rare, the increase in cases of scientific fraud has contributed to the development of authorship guidelines which, as we will see later, emphasize the responsibility of researchers for the validity of the articles’ content.\n\n\n6.2.3 Reputation economy\nAuthorship, among other things, provides scientific capital to the researcher. Once known and recognized by the other researchers in the field, this scientific capital is converted into symbolic capital (Bourdieu 1987). Authorship is the basis of the social stratification of scientific fields, and all the layers of the hierarchy of rewards, from the simple citation to the Nobel Prize (Cole and Cole 1973). There is no social structure of science without authorship."

    "section": "6.3 Authorship in a collaborative context",
    "text": "6.3 Authorship in a collaborative context\nThe byline of an article ultimately depends on two elements:\n\nThe nature and extent of the contribution of those involved in the works (who did what?)\nThe decisions made about naming and ordering authors (who will be an author, and in what order will the names be listed?)\n\nThese questions can be difficult to answer in a context where science is increasingly complex and collaborative Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi (2007).\n\n6.3.1 Collaboration and division of labour\nLaudel (2002) identified six types de collaboration related to the types of contributions that individuals can make to a given research project:\n\nCollaboration involving a division of intellectual labour. Collaborators with a shared goal who make substantial intellectual contribution towards that goal. They are to some degree co-leading the research.\nService collaboration. Researchers who are called upon to produce routine work that require a specific expertise.\nProvision of access to research equipment. The collaborator does not perform any tasks related to the project but provides material, equipment, data, etc. used for the research.\nTransmission of know-how. The non-creative transmission of information stored in memory that is useful for the research.\nMutual stimulation: The stimulation and engagement through informal interactions that helps researchers develop their ideas.\nTrusted assessorship:Providing feedback on the work.\n\nNot all these forms of collaboration lead to authorship. Laudel (2002) found that authorship is usually attributed to collaborators of the first two types only.\nSubramanyam (1983) proposed four types of collaboration related to the hierarchical status of the involved individuals:\n\nSame-status collaborations.\nProfessor-student collaborations.\nSupervisor-assistant collaborations.\nResearcher-consultant collaborations.\n\nThe number of people required for a given project can have an influence on the types of collaboration that will take place. According to Walsh and Lee (2015), larger teams tend to lead to more bureaucratic organizational structures, which is characterized by increased division of labour, specialization and standardization of tasks, hierarchical relationships, and decentralized decision-making (Walsh et Lee, 2015).\nLes formes de collaboration privilégiées par les chercheurs ne sont pas seulement déterminées par leurs préférences personnelles, mais aussi par la nature des travaux de recherche effectués. Celle-ci est définie par l'objectif institutionnel de production de connaissances dont découlent des impératifs techniques et moraux (Merton, 1942). Cet objectif commun ou, selon Bourdieu (1976), les intérêts des agents dominants définissent les enjeux scientifiques (les objets de recherche) qui sont d'intérêts pour les agents du champ qui recherchent les investissements les plus payants en capital symbolique (Bourdieu, 1976). L'objet de recherche définit les ressources humaines et matérielles ainsi que les savoirs et savoir-faire requis, ce qui peut en quelque sorte imposer aux chercheurs certains types de collaboration et de division du travail. Cette idée est bien illustrée par la notion de culture épistémique (Knorr Cetina, 1999) qui désigne la particularité des pratiques de création des connaissances dans une discipline.\nAssigning authorship can be difficult when they are the outcome of the work of many individuals with different status, role and contributions. Decisions have to be made about 1) who will be an author (not all contributions lead to authorship) and 2) the order of the names, which is usually meant to indicate what share of the credit each one deserves (D. Pontille 2006). It can be extremely difficult for an external observer to determine who did what or what share of credit everyone deserves Rennie, Yank, and Emanuel (1997) .\n\n\n6.3.2 Naming authors\nUnlike the concept of author in literature, which is linked with writing, the concept of author in science is not and other forms of contributions can lead to authorship. Moreover, as D. Pontille (2006) points out, the act of writing is not necessarily sufficient to obtain the author status, and it is also possible to be an author without writing. So what kind of contributions do lead to authorship? Contributions involving the division of intellectual labour (first type of collaboration identified by Laudel (2002)). This linked between the substantial intellectual contribution and authorship generates little to no debate in the literature. However, whether authorship should be awarded to individuals with technical, routine, or less substantial contributions is not so clear.\nHagstrom (1964) tackles the question of authorship for technical contributions by looking at the historical context and distinguishing traditional collaboration from modern collaboration. He portrays the traditional technician as having little qualifications and being involved in the search for solutions to scientific problems but performing simple tasks designed and assigned by the scientist in exchange for economic capital. In contrast, the modern technician is a qualified professional performing complex tasks that the researcher employing them may not know how to perform themselves. This professionalization of the technician is nicely illustrated by Knorr-Cetina (1999) who tells the story of an established researcher who mastered the theories of his field but was unable to execute the technical tasks their research required. This type of relationship between the scientist and the technician is not generalized and technical contributions do not always lead to authorship today Laudel (2002).\nThe type of contribution is not always the only determinant. The same task performed by a paid technician or by another researcher may lead to authorship for the latter but not the former Shibayama, Walsh, and Baba (2012).\nThe importance of a discovery can also affect authorship attribution. Jabbehdari et Walsh (2017) found that the individuals who performed technical or less subtantial contributions are more often excluded from the byline of highly cited work.\nThe relationship between the nature and extent of a contribution and authorship is also determined by implicit disciplinary norms. Some type of contributions that often lead to authorship in a discipline may not (and may even be considered unethical) in another (Bozeman and Youtie 2016). For example, in Sociology, writing remains one of the most important contribution and tends to be required to be an author David. Pontille (2004). However, Pontille distinguishes French Sociology from American Sociology, where authorship norms are more inclusive. This highlights that the disciplinary context is not entirely independent from the local context. In physics, we find the special case of mega collaborations leading to articles signed by hundreds (or thousands) of authors; a phenomena that Cronin (2001) calls “hyperauthorsip”. In this context, it is the affiliation to the collective, and not a specific contribution to the publication, that justifies authorship Knorr-Cetina (1999).\n\n6.3.2.1 Guest and ghost authors\nDans certains cas, il peut exister une relation très faible, voire inexistante entre la contribution effectuée et l'obtention du statut d'auteur. Il est fréquent, par exemple, que des auteurs honorifiques (guest ou honorary authors) signent des articles alors que leur contribution était très superficielle ou encore nulle, alors que d'autres, les auteurs fantômes (ghost authors), ne signent pas alors qu'ils ont réalisé une partie importante du travail (Bates, Anić, Marušić et Marušić, 2004; Flanagin et al., 1998; Godlee, 1996; Huth, 1986b; Katz et Martin, 2007; Mowatt et al., 2002; Sismondo, 2009; Wager, 2007a; Wislar, Flanagin, Fontanarosa et Deangelis, 2011).\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Acknowledgements\nDe plus, il est fréquent que les individus ainsi exclus de la liste des auteurs soient remerciés dans l'article (Cronin et Overfelt, 1994; Laudel, 2002). Les différences disciplinaires observées dans le nombre d'auteurs moyen par article sont d'ailleurs grandement réduites lorsqu'on tient compte à la fois des auteurs et des individus remerciés (Paul-Hus et al., 2017), ce qui suggère que ces différences ne découlent pas seulement du nombre de chercheurs ayant contribué à la recherche, mais peut-être aussi de différences disciplinaires dans les pratiques d'attribution du statut d'auteur, possiblement en ce qui concerne la valorisation des contributions des techniciens ou des assistants de recherche. Il importe ici de souligner la distinction entre l'auteur fantôme et le remercié. Le premier désigne l'individu qui n'a pas obtenu le statut d'auteur alors que sa contribution aurait normalement justifié une telle reconnaissance. Les remerciements sont plutôt utilisés, en principe, pour souligner une contribution dont l'ampleur ne justifie pas l'attribution du statut d'auteur (Kassirer et Angell, 1991). L'existence des auteurs honorifiques, des auteurs fantômes et des contributeurs remerciés met en évidence le fait que la liste des auteurs peut dans certains cas mener à une sous-estimation (Moulopoulos, Sideris et Georgilis, 1983; Paul-Hus, Mongeon, Sainte-Marie et Larivière, 2017; Rennie et Flanagin, 1994) ou à une surestimation (King, 2000) du nombre de chercheurs ayant contribué à une recherche.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Ordering authors\nAuthorship decisions are not only about who will be an author but also in what order the names will be listed, which is usually intended to reflect the importance of individual contributions to the work (Zuckerman 1968). In this section, we survey ordering approaches used in science.\n\n6.3.3.1 Alphabetical order\nAlphabetical order is sometimes used to distribute credit equally between members of the research team. It is also standard practice in some fields like Mathematics and Economics. This mode of ordering is also often used in hyperauthorship situations where the specific individual contributions are difficult to capture and order Knorr-Cetina (1999). Sometimes the authors will be grouped by institution or country first, and then ordered alphabetically within each group. The use of alphabetical in some cases but not always can generate some ambiguity since the first (or last) authors might be perceived has having made more important contributions than others even if that is not the case. Furthermore, it is possible for alphabetical order to occur by chance, sending a signal that authors may have contributed equally despite it not being the case (Zuckerman 1968).\n\n\n6.3.3.2 Decreasing order of contribution\nAuthors can also be listed based on the importance of their contribution, the first authors having typically contributed the most. This is a dominant mode of name ordering in Social Sciences and Humanities where writing is key (David. Pontille 2004). One limitation of this approach is that there is only one author at any position in the list. This issue is sometimes addressed by adding a note in the byline indicating that some authors contributed equally to the work (Hu 2009). According to Zuckerman (1967), prominent researchers sometimes let there less well-known collaborators take first authorship even if they may have contributed less.\n\n\n6.3.3.3 From the outside in\nA variant of the decreasing order of contribution exists predominantly some fields of Natural or Biomedical Sciences where research often occurs in laboratories. The difference is that the two ends of the byline (the first and last author positions) are the most important. The first author tends to be a junior researcher (a PhD student or postdoc) who lead the experiment. The last author is the lab director. Other contributors are listed in decreasing order of contribution between these two poles, those who contributed the least being in the middle of the byline (D. Pontille 2006).\n\n\n6.3.3.4 Hybrid (partial alphabetical order)\nZuckerman (1968) décrit un dernier type d'ordonnancement que nous appellerons « ordre alphabétique partiel » et selon lequel un sous-ensemble des auteurs est en ordre alphabétique afin de mettre en évidence la contribution particulière d'un auteur (normalement le premier ou le dernier). Cette idée a été reprise par Mongeon et al. (2017) qui ont mesuré la prévalence des cas où seul un sous-ensemble des auteurs situés au centre de la liste est en ordre alphabétique. L'ordre alphabétique est ici utilisé pour créer une distinction entre les auteurs principaux (au début de la liste), les auteurs ayant joué un rôle de supervision (à la fin de la liste) et les autres (au milieu de la liste, en ordre alphabétique), dont la contribution est généralement moindre (Mongeon et al., 2017). Bien que les modes d'ordonnancement des auteurs présentés ci-dessus soient les plus fréquemment utilisés, il arrive aussi que les chercheurs utilisent d'autres critères, parfois arbitraires ou ludiques, pour déterminer l'ordre des auteurs (Cabanac, 2015).\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Categorizing authors\nSome scholars have proposed to divide authors in categories. Perneger et al. (2017) identified three types of authors in biomedical research:\n\nThe thinker who designs the work, acquires funding for it, and revises the article.\nThe soldier who provides material, administrative or technical support or participates in the data collection.\nThe scribe who analyzes and interprets the results and drafts the article.\n\nSimilarly, Baerlocher et al. (2007) proposed the following categories:\n\nPrimary authors participate to the planing and execution of the study, and to drafting the article. They are able to explain all the findings and share responsibility for the exactitude of the information reported in the article. They generally appear at the beginning of the byline.\nSenior/supervisory authors plan and supervise the study, and subtantialy revise the draft. Like primary authors, they can explain all the findings in the study and share responsibility for the exactitude of the infomration reported in the article. They are generally at the end of the byline.\nContributing authors make a substantial contribution to the work but do not meat the criteria or primary and senior/supervisory authorship. They are not necessarily able to explain all of the findings of the study and they are not responsible for the exactitude of the information reported in the article. They generally appear in the middle of the byline."

    "text": "6.5 Contribution statements\nRennie, Yank, and Emanuel (1997) proposed a model that would replace authors with a list of contributors and guarantors. In their model, contributors include everyone who contributed, no matter the nature and extent of their contribution, and guarantors are those contributors who are responsible for the integrity of the work as a whole. In addition, the article should include a description of the work done by each contributor. The model is recommended (but not required) by the ICMJE guidelines and the Council of Science Editors, and it is applied (although partially) by an increasingly large number of journals requiring that the respective contributions of the authors be indicated, typically in a contribution statement.\nHowever, the informative value of these statements remain limited. Firstly, only the type (and not the extent) of contributions are indicated. According to Ilakovac et al. (2006), contribution statements are also imprecise as they rely on the limited memory (and limited motivation) of researchers who are asked to produce them. A third of the participants to a survey indicated that contribution statements provide are not more informative than the order in which the authors are listed (Sauermann and Haeussler 2017)."

    "section": "6.3 Authorship practices an norms",
    "text": "6.3 Authorship practices an norms\nThe byline of an article ultimately depends on two elements:\n\nThe nature and extent of the contribution of those involved in the works (who did what?)\nThe decisions made about naming and ordering authors (who will be an author, and in what order will the names be listed?)\n\nThese questions can be difficult to answer in a context where science is increasingly complex and collaborative (Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007).\n\n6.3.1 Collaboration and division of labour\nLaudel (2002) identified six types of collaboration related to the types of contributions that individuals can make to a given research project:\n\nCollaboration involving a division of intellectual labour. Collaborators with a shared goal who make substantial intellectual contribution towards that goal. They are to some degree co-leading the research.\nService collaboration. Researchers who are called upon to produce routine work that require a specific expertise.\nProvision of access to research equipment. The collaborator does not perform any tasks related to the project but provides material, equipment, data, etc. used for the research.\nTransmission of know-how. The non-creative transmission of information stored in memory that is useful for the research.\nMutual stimulation: The stimulation and engagement through informal interactions that helps researchers develop their ideas.\nTrusted assessorship: Providing feedback on the work.\n\nNot all these forms of collaboration lead to authorship. Laudel (2002) found that authorship is usually attributed to collaborators of the first two types only.\nSubramanyam (1983) proposed four types of collaboration related to the hierarchical status of the involved individuals:\n\nSame-status collaborations.\nProfessor-student collaborations.\nSupervisor-assistant collaborations.\nResearcher-consultant collaborations.\n\nThe number of people required for a given project can have an influence on the types of collaboration that will take place. According to Walsh and Lee (2015), larger teams tend to lead to more bureaucratic organizational structures, characterized by increased division of labour, specialization and standardization of tasks, hierarchical relationships, and decentralized decision-making.\nAssigning authorship can be difficult when a work is the outcome of  many individuals with different statuses, roles, and contributions. Decisions have to be made about 1) who will be an author (not all contributions lead to authorship) and 2) the order of the names, which is usually meant to indicate what share of the credit each one deserves (Pontille 2006). It can be extremely difficult for an external observer to determine who did what or what share of credit everyone deserves (Rennie, Yank, and Emanuel 1997).\n\n\n6.3.2 Naming authors\nUnlike the concept of author in literature, which is linked with writing, the concept of author in science is not and other forms of contributions can lead to authorship. Moreover, as Pontille (2006) points out, the act of writing is not necessarily sufficient to obtain author status, and it is also possible to be an author without writing. So what kind of contributions do lead to authorship? Contributions involving the division of intellectual labour (the first type of collaboration identified by Laudel (2002)). This link between substantial intellectual contribution and authorship generates little to no debate in the literature. However, whether authorship should be awarded to individuals with technical, routine, or less substantial contributions is not so clear.\nHagstrom (1964) tackles the question of authorship for technical contributions by looking at the historical context and distinguishing traditional collaboration from modern collaboration. He portrays the traditional technician as having few qualifications and being involved in the search for solutions to scientific problems but performing simple tasks designed and assigned by the scientist in exchange for economic capital. In contrast, the modern technician is a qualified professional performing complex tasks that the researcher employing them may not know how to perform themselves. This professionalization of the technician is nicely illustrated by Knorr-Cetina (1999) who tells the story of an established researcher who mastered the theories of his field but was unable to execute the technical tasks their research required. This type of relationship between the scientist and the technician is not generalized and technical contributions do not always lead to authorship today (Haeussler and Sauermann 2015; Larivière et al. 2016; Laudel 2002).\nThe type of contribution is not always the only determinant. The same task performed by a paid technician or by another researcher may lead to authorship for the latter but not the former (Pontille 2016; Shibayama, Walsh, and Baba 2012).\nThe importance of a discovery can also affect authorship attribution. Jabbehdari and Walsh (2017) found that the individuals who performed technical or less substantial contributions are more often excluded from the byline of highly cited work.\nThe relationship between the nature and extent of a contribution and authorship is also determined by implicit disciplinary norms. Some type of contributions that often lead to authorship in a discipline may not (and may even be considered unethical) in another (Bozeman and Youtie 2016). For example, in sociology, writing remains one of the most important contribution and tends to be required to be an author (Pontille 2004). However, Pontille distinguishes French sociology from American sociology, where authorship norms are more inclusive. This highlights that the disciplinary context is not entirely independent from the local context. In physics, we find the special case of mega-collaborations leading to articles signed by hundreds (or thousands) of authors; a phenomena that Cronin (2001) calls “hyperauthorsip”. In this context, it is the affiliation to the collective and not a specific contribution to the publication, that justifies authorship (Biagioli et al. 2003; Birnholtz 2006; Knorr-Cetina 1999).\n\n6.3.2.1 Guest authors, ghost authors, and acknowledgees\nIn some cases, the relationship between an individual’s contribution to a work and the authorship status can be weak or nonexistent. It is frequent for individuals to be named as (guest) authors despite having made very little or no contribution to the work, and for individuals to not appear on the byline despite having offered a significant contribution to the work (ghost authors) (Bates et al. 2004; Flanagin et al. 1998; Sismondo 2009; Mowatt et al. 2002; Wislar et al. 2011). Contributors excluded from the byline are sometimes acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of the article to signal their contribution to the work (Kassirer and Angell 1991). Paul-Hus et al. (2017) found that the disciplinary differences in the number of authors are greatly reduced when we consider combined authors and acknowledgees, which suggests that these differences are not a reflection of the different number of contributors involved, but also of disciplinary differences in authorship practices. Overall, the existence of guest authors, ghost authors, and acknowledgees suggests that the byline can misrepresent the composition and size of research teams.\n\n\n\n6.3.3 Ordering authors\nAuthorship decisions are not only about who will be an author but also in what order the names will be listed, which is usually intended to reflect the importance of individual contributions to the work (Zuckerman 1968). In this section, we survey ordering approaches used in science.\n\n6.3.3.1 Alphabetical order\nAlphabetical order is sometimes used to distribute credit equally between members of the research team. It is also standard practice in some fields like Mathematics and Economics. This mode of ordering is also often used in hyperauthorship situations where specific individual contributions are difficult to capture and order (Knorr-Cetina 1999). Sometimes the authors will be grouped by institution or country first, and then ordered alphabetically within each group. The use of alphabetical in some cases but not always can generate some ambiguity since the first (or last) authors might be perceived as having made more important contributions than others even if that is not the case. Furthermore, it is possible for alphabetical ordering to occur by chance, sending a signal that authors may have contributed equally despite it not being the case (Zuckerman 1968).\n\n\n6.3.3.2 Decreasing order of contribution\nAuthors can also be listed based on the importance of their contribution, the first authors having typically contributed the most. This is a dominant mode of name ordering in Social Sciences and Humanities where writing is key (Pontille 2004). One limitation of this approach is that there is only one author at any position in the list. This issue is sometimes addressed by adding a note in the byline indicating that some authors contributed equally to the work (Hu 2009). According to Zuckerman (1967), prominent researchers sometimes let their less well-known collaborators take first authorship, even if they may have contributed less.\n\n\n6.3.3.3 From the outside in\nA variant of the decreasing order of contribution exists predominantly some fields of natural or biomedical sciences where research often occurs in laboratories. The difference is that the two ends of the byline (the first and last author positions) are the most important. The first author tends to be a junior researcher (a PhD student or postdoc) who lead the experiment. The last author is the lab director. Other contributors are listed in decreasing order of contribution between these two poles, those who contributed the least being in the middle of the byline (Pontille 2006).\n\n\n6.3.3.4 Hybrid (partial alphabetical order)\nZuckerman (1968) described another type of ordering that I call partial alphabetical order, in which a subset of authors are listed alphabetically to highlight the contribution of the other authors who are not part of the alphabetical list. This phenomenon was studied by Mongeon et al. (2017) who showed how alphabetical order is used in biomedical research to distinguish primary authors (at the beginning of the byline), the supervisory authors (at the end of the byline), and the others (in the middle of the byline, in alphabetical order).\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Categorizing authors\nSome scholars have proposed to divide authors in categories. Perneger et al. (2017) identified three types of authors in biomedical research:\n\nThe thinker who designs the work, acquires funding for it, and revises the article.\nThe soldier who provides material, administrative or technical support or participates in the data collection.\nThe scribe who analyzes and interprets the results and drafts the article.\n\nSimilarly, Baerlocher et al. (2007) proposed the following categories:\n\nPrimary authors participate in the planning and execution of the study, and in drafting the article. They are able to explain all the findings and share responsibility for the exactitude of the information reported in the article. They generally appear at the beginning of the byline.\nSenior/supervisory authors plan and supervise the study, and substantially revise the draft. Like primary authors, they can explain all the findings in the study and share responsibility for the exactitude of the information reported in the article. They are generally at the end of the byline.\nContributing authors make a substantial contribution to the work but do not meet the criteria or primary and senior/supervisory authorship. They are not necessarily able to explain all of the findings of the study and they are not responsible for the exactitude of the information reported in the article. They generally appear in the middle of the byline.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Authorship guidelines\nScholarly societies and journal editors have developed authorship guidelines in response to the lack of standards in authorship practices (Osborne and Holland 2009), the increased number of authors on articles, and the increase in cases of scientific misconduct (Pontille 2016; Steen 2010) bringing forth the relationship between authorship and responsibility (Rennie and Flanagin 1994). Large research teams are most frequent in Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Health Sciences (Wuchty, Jones, and Uzzi 2007), and misconduct is most frequent in the Health Sciences (Fang, Steen, and Casadevall 2012). It is thus not surprising that these are research areas where authorship guidelines are frequently found (Bošnjak and Marušić 2012; Wager 2007).\nJournals rarely create their own authorship guidelines. Instead, they refer to the code of ethics of professional associations or publishers’ guidelines, which tend to refer to the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The ICMJE recommendations include four criteria that must be met by all authors of a paper:\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work;\nDrafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content;\nFinal approval of the version to be published;\nAgreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nEven though their adoption is not generalized even in the Medical field (Bošnjak and Marušić 2012) these recommendation have a wide influence beyond this field. For instance, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the European Association of Science Editors (EASE), and major publishers like Elsevier, Springer-Nature, and Wiley-Blackwell refer to it.\nDespite the existence of these guidelines, there is no consensus on what constitutes a substantial contribution that should lead to authorship (Claxton 2005). Even when they do mention the type of tasks that matter for authorship, guidelines remain vague regarding the magnitude of the contribution required, simply stating that it should be substantial. Editors themselves are not convinced of the efficacy of the guidelines for reducing practices like guest and ghost authorship (Wager 2009). In sum, while guidelines might be able to help research teams with their authorship decisions, they seem to have a limited effect on these practices, and to be unable to address unethical authorship issues.\n\n\n6.3.6 Contribution statements\nRennie, Yank, and Emanuel (1997) proposed a model that would replace authors with a list of contributors and guarantors. In their model, contributors include everyone who contributed, no matter the nature and extent of their contribution, and guarantors are those contributors who are responsible for the integrity of the work as a whole. In addition, the article should include a description of the work done by each contributor. The model is recommended (but not required) by the ICMJE guidelines and the Council of Science Editors, and it is applied (although partially) by an increasingly large number of journals requiring that the respective contributions of the authors be indicated, typically in a contribution statement.\nHowever, the informative value of these statements remains limited. Firstly, only the type (and not the extent) of contributions is indicated. According to Ilakovac et al. (2006), contribution statements are also imprecise as they rely on the limited memory (and limited motivation) of researchers who are asked to produce them. A third of the respondants to a survey indicated that contribution statements provide are not more informative than the order in which the authors are listed (Sauermann and Haeussler 2017)."

    "text": "5.2 Classification (the noun)\nA classification is essentially a list of categories in which entities can be classified (what disciplines exist). Many classifications have been developed by organizations around the world, and the best classification to use is often determined by availability as well as the subject and goals of the analysis. Below are a few examples of general classifications (that cover all disciplines) and disciplinary classifications (that cover single disciplines with a higher level of granularity than the general classifications).\n\n5.2.1 General classifications\n\nThe Science Metrix classification of research outputs categorizes scientific journals and articles in 5 domains, 20 fields and 174 subfields. The classification can be downloaded here.\nThe Scopus All Science Journal Classification (ASJC) divides journals in 334 fields and 4 research areas. The list of ASJC fields can be found here.\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) classification is a tried and tested mutually exclusive classification used in the Science & Engineering Indicators since the 1970s. It was originally designed by CHI Research (Archambault, Beauchesne, and Caruso 2011). It contains three layers: 2 domains, 14 fields, and 143 specialties.\nThe Web of Science Subject Categories is a journal-level non-exclusive classification of journals in 250 subject categories available in the Web of Science. More information can be found here.\nThe Field of Science and Technology (FOS) classification of the OECD has 40 FOS grouped in six broad fields. Details can be found here. The Web of Science provides a mapping of the FOS and the Web of Science subject categories here.\nThe fields of research (FOR) from the Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification (ANZSRC). The FOR have three levels: divisions, groups, and fields. You can find more details on the ANZSRC website. This classification is used by the Dimensions database to assign FOR to articles and to calculate the field citation ratio (FCR), which we will discuss again in chapter 7.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Disciplinary classifications\nSome disciplines have developed their own classification. Here are some examples.\n\nThe Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are used in PubMed and Medline databases to facilitate searching (details here).\nThe Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) (details here).\nThe Journal of Economics Literature (JEL) classification in economics (details here)\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Computational (bottom up) approaches\nThere exists a variety of computational approaches to divide any set of entities into groups that can (both do not always) make sense. Topic models are an example. That said, topic models are not that popular in bibliometric studies, for which researchers tend to adopt citation-based networks approaches (discussed in more details below)."

Depending on the objective of your analysis, it may be preferable to use the classification already available in the database you are using (or to choose a database that uses the classification that best suits your needs).\nBut how do we assign a discipline to another entity, like a researcher?\n\nDo we use the discipline of their PhD?\nDo we use the discipline of their current department or faculty?\nDo we use the discipline classification of their articles or the journals in which they are published?\n\nThere is no right answer to these questions. Most often our main guide will be data availability and quality. The discipline of the Ph.D., for instance, is an information rarely available other than on the CV of the researcher. Furthermore, not all bibliographic records include the department of the authors, and when they do, they do not usually use controlled vocabulary so the same departments can come up with different names or spelling, and sometimes it will require some web searching to figure out the discipline to which the department could be assigned to. Moreover, the department names might not match your disciplinary classification which can make the pairing of departments with disciplines challenging. If the publications in our database are assigned to one or many disciplines, we can infer the discipline of the researcher using the papers they published, or the journals in which they published. What do we do when a researcher has 5 publications in Physics, 3 in chemistry and 4 in economics? Is that person a Physicist, a Chemist, an Economist? A mix?"

    "section": "5.4 Describing disciplines",
    "text": "5.4 Describing disciplines\nHow can we represent disciplines (topics of interest, journals, researchers) using bibliometrics? The “simple” answer is that we can describe a discipline by looking at the entities that we put into that box. For example, to describe the field of management , we can look at the articles or journals that were assigned to the management discipline through some classification mechanism. Then we can look at different entities associated with these articles such as terms used in the articles (as a proxy for topics), journals, researchers, institutions, and countries to describe what the discipline is about, what are its main journals, and who are the agents involved in it. This can be done in two main ways: rankings and networks.\n\n5.4.1 Rankings\nBibliometric data is usually asymmetrically distributed so that:\n\nA minority of researchers publish the majority of papers (Lotka’s law)\nA minority of journals publish the majority of works on a subject (Bradford’s law)\nA minority of words used account for the majority of occurrences (Zipf’s law)\nA minority of articles (of a researcher, a journal, a discipline, etc.) account for the majority of the citations in the whole (Larivière et al. 2016).\n\nBecause of this, disciplines or other areas of research are sometimes described by identifying the most frequent keywords, journals, authors, and institutions. Because these types of analyses are easily done with the Web version of databases like Web of Science and Scopus, they are very popular among scholars outside of the bibliometrics field who often use the ranking methods to provide an empirical account of the main topics and actors involved in their area of expertise. These descriptions are however very limited and are ideally used with complementary approaches such as networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nListing most frequent words used in titles and abstracts of articles published in a field without any other processing will not produce a meaningful representation of the topics of interest in a field given the presence of stop words (a, the, it, when, if) and other generic terms (research, data, results, analysis, etc.). So, it is important to filter out those words so the top words included in a table can adequately reflect the core topics of the discipline one is trying to describe.\nWhat is a topic?\nTopic and terms are not equivalent, and a topic is usually represented by a set of terms. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic topic could be represented by terms like coronavirus, COVID, COVID-19, Omicron, etc. This is something to keep in mind as you dive into the data and try to determine what topics are or interest within a discipline or any set of publications.\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Disciplines as networks\nThe structure of a discipline can be represented as a network of agents and research objects that are connected with one another to some degree. Different kinds of networks are typically used in bibliometrics:\n\n5.4.2.1 Co-occurrence networks\nCo-occurrence networks are undirected networks in which the edges are determined by the appearance of two entities in a set. Typical types of co-occurence networks include:\n\nTerm co-occurrence networks are constructed by considering in how many articles two terms appear together (co-occur). For example, if an article’s title, abstract or keywords contains the terms “COVID-19” and “vaccine”, then the terms “COVID-19” and “Vaccines” are linked.\nBibliographic coupling networks. Bibliographic coupling occurs when two articles contain a reference to the same article. For example, if article B and C both cite article A, then B and C are linked.\nCo-citation networks. A co-citation between two articles occurs when they are both cited together in another article. For example, if article B and C are cited by articles A, then B and C are related. One of the issues with co-citations is that they take time to accumulate, so networks of recent articles are less accurate since the citations have yet form links between the articles.\n\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Direct citation network\nDirect citation networks are the most common for of directed networks that one will come across in bibliometrics. In a directed network, the relationship between two nodes has a direction: So when article A cites article B, a direct citation link from article A to article B is created. This is not the same as a direct citation link between article B and article A. In fact, it is extremely unlikely for A to cite B AND for B to cite A. Indeed, articles usually cite other articles that have already been published, which means that the cited articles can not cite the citing articles back.\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Networks in practice\nIf you completed the Data Management course (INFO6540) you might remember that a network has two core components: nodes and edges (also called vertices, or links).\n\n5.4.3.1 Nodes\nNode lists are typically comma- or tab-delimited files with a minimum of two columns:\n\nId. A unique identifier for the node\nLabel. A label for the node.\n\nYou can add as many columns as you wish with information about the nodes that you can use in your network visualization to adjust the color and size of the nodes or their labels. In fact, the label column is also not mandatory, and you could, in principle, have a nodes list with only an id column.\n\nExample of a nodes list.\n\n\nId\nLabel\nCitations\nDiscipline\nany other column\n\n\n\n\n1\nArticle A\n13\nChemistry\n…\n\n\n2\nArticle B\n5\nPhysics\n…\n\n\n3\nArticle C\n3\nInformation Science\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3.2 Edges\nIn an edge list, you will typically have a source node, a target node, the strength of their relationship and whether that relationship is directed or undirected. Note that when the network is undirected, it does not matter what nodes are entered in the source column and which ones are in the target column. However, you want to have each combinations of nodes be unique. For example, in the example edge list below, you would not want to include a row with node 2 as a target and node 1 as a source, because that edge is already captured in the first row.\n\nExample of an edges list\n\n\nSource\nTarget\nWeight\nType\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n4\nundirected\n\n\n1\n3\n2\nundirected\n\n\n2\n3\n1\nundirected\n\n\n\nThe weight column contains a numerical value that represents the strength of the link between the nodes. If we are building a co-citation network, then the weight would be the number of articles that cite both the source node and the target node. The edges list above thus indicates that article A and article B have been cited together 4 times, article A and article B 2 times, and article B and article C 1 time. This would suggest that article A and article B are more closely related to each other than to article C.\n\n\n5.4.3.3 Visualizing the networks\n\nVOSviewer is a free software developed by Nees Jan van Eck and Ludo Waltman of the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) of Leiden University. The website includes a lot of useful information to get you started.\nGephi is an open-source network visualization and analysis software. It offers more features and flexibility than VOSviewer, at the price of a slightly steeper learning curve. You can download Gephi here."
